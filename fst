Arduino使用DHT11温湿度传感器获取环境温湿度

2017年09月18日







Arduino使用DHT11温湿度传感器获取环境温湿度

通过本文，可以了解到以下内容：

DHT11 温湿度传感器接线与使用DHT11 Arduino 测试程序编写DHT11 温湿度转换显示





DHT11 温湿度传感器接线与使用

DHT11 是一款温湿度传感器，可以用来测试环境温湿度，该传感器的的温度测量范围为 0 ~ 50°C,误差为 2 °C；湿度测量范围为在 0°C时为30%-90%RH，环境温度为 25°C时，湿度测量范围为20%-90%RH，在50°C时，测量范围是20%-80%。

DHT11 传感器接线方法并不复杂，DHT11封装有4个引脚，各个引脚说明如下：




 id   名称   注释
  
  1   VDD   供电 3-5.5 VDC
  
  2   DATA  串行数据，单总线
  
  3   NC    空脚
  
  4   GND   接地，电源负极
  
  
  
  
  
  一般从网上买的 Arduino 传感器套件版本的 DHT11，会有一个带 LED 的焊好的板，上面有三个接线引脚，分别是 VCC, GND, DATA，接线时，只要将 VCC 接到 Arduino 5V上，GND 接到 Arduino GND 上，DATA 引脚接 Arduino Pin8上即可。
  
  
  
  DHT11 Arduino 测试程序编写

DHT11 Arduino 的测试程序也很简单，主要分几个部分： 
- 引入 dht11 库 
- 设置端口 
- 检查 DHT11 是否正确连接 
- 获取 DHT11 测量数据

程序详细如下：



code : 

 // 引入 DHT 库文件 如果没有 先从网上下载好 在 Arduino 中导入
 
 #include <dht11.h>
 
 dht11 DHT11;
 
 // 设置 DHT 引脚 为 Pin 8
 
 #define DHT11PIN 8
 
 void setup () {
 
   Serial . begin ( 9600 );
   
   Serial . println ( "dht11 test program");
   
   Serial . print ( "library" );
   
   // 输出 DHT 库的版本号
   
   Serial . println ( DHT11LIB_VERSION );
   
   Serial . println ();
   
   }
   
   
   void loop () {
   
     Serial . println ( "\n" );
     
     int check  =  DHT11.read ( DHT11PIN );
     
     
     // 测试 DHT 是否正确连接
     
     Serial . print ( "Read sensor: " );
     
     
     switch  ( chk ) {
     
     
       case DHTLIB_OK:
       
         Serial . println ( "OK" );
         
         break;
         
         
       case DHTLIB_ERROR_CHECKSUM:
       
         Serial . println ( "checksum error" );
         
         break;
       
       
       case DHTLIB_ERROR_TIMEOUT:
         
         Serial . println ( "time out error" );
         
         break;
         
         
       default:
       
         Serial . println ( "unknown error" );
         
         break;
         
         }
         
         
         // 获取测量数据
         
         Serial . print ( "Humidity (%): ");
         
         Serial . println (  ( float ) DHT11 . humidity,  2  );
         
         Serial . print ( "Temperature °C): " );
         
         Serial . println (  ( float ) DHT11 . temperature,  2  );
         
         delay ( 2000 );
         
         
         
         
         
         
程序编写完成后，上传到 Arduino，重启 Arduino ，再在 Arduino IDE 的串口监视器中可以看到测量数据。






DHT11 温湿度测量数据单位转换

我们习惯常用的温度单位是摄氏度，湿度单位是百分比。但实际生产中，有可能需要用到其他的单位，以下是参考 arduino.cc 上提供的温度转换函数供参考。




// celsius to Fahrenheit conversion


 double Fahrenheit ( double celsius ) {
 
   return 1.8 * celsius + 32;
   
 }
 
 
 // fast integer version with rounding
 
  /*
 
 int Celcius2Fahrenheit ( int celcius )

 {
 
  return  ( celsius * 18 + 5 )  /  10  +  32;
  
 }
 
 */
 
 
 
 // Celsius to Kelvin conversion
 
  double Kelvin ( double celsius ) {
  
    return  celsius + 273.15;
    
  }
  
  
  // dewPoint function NOAA
  
  // reference (1) : http://wahiduddin.net/calc/density_algorithms.htm
  // reference (2) : http://www.colorado.edu/geography/weather_station/Geog_site/about.htm
  
  
  double dewPoint (  double celsius,  double humidity  ) {
  
  // (1) Saturation Vapor Pressure = ESGG ( T )
  
  double RATIO  =  373.15  /  ( 273.15 + celsius );
  
  double RHS    =  -7.90298 * ( RATIO - 1 );
  
         RHS   +=  5.02808 * log10 ( RATIO );
         
         RHS   +=  -1.3816e-7   *   (    pow  (  10,  ( 11.344 * ( 1 - 1 / RATIO )  )  )    -  1  ) ;
         
         RHS   +=  8.1328e-3    *   (    pow  (  10,  ( -3.49149 * ( RATIO - 1 )  )  )    - 1  ) ;
         
         RHS   +=  log10 ( 1013.246 );
         
         // factor -3 is to adjust units - Vapor Pressure SVP * humidity
        
        
   double VP  =  pow (  10,  RHS - 3  )  *  humidity;
   
   // (2) DEWPOINT = F(Vapor Pressure)
   
   double T  =  log ( VP / 0.61078 );
   
   // temp var return (241.88 * T) / (17.558 - T);
   
   }
   
   
   
   
   
   // delta max = 0.6544 wrt dewPoint()
   
   // 6.9 x faster than dewPoint()
   
   // reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point
   
   
   
   double dewPointFast ( double celsius, double humidity ) {
   
     double a = 17.271;
     
     double b = 237.7;
     
     double temp  =  ( a * celsius ) / ( b + celsius ) + log ( humidity * 0.01 );
     
     double Td  =  ( b * temp )  /  ( a - temp );
     
     return Td;
     
   }
   
   
   
   
   上面的代码可以根据实际情况，将 DHT11 的测量数据带入函数进行转换即可。

小结

本文介绍了如果连接、使用 DHT11 温湿度传感器，并且介绍了 DHT11 的测试程序如何编写。另外，有一点自己在实验的时候遇到的一个小问题，就是我所使用的 UNO R3 Arduino 主板的 DIGITAL 引线排从小到大分别是 RX0 TX1 PIN2 ……，我开始没有认真看清楚，以为 RX0 TX1 之后是 Pin0，我最初设置使用的引脚是 Pin 2，因此我错误的把引线接到 Pin 3上，串口监视器一直没有信息，我以为是传感器坏了，后来更换 Pin 口，才发现了这个小失误，所以希望读者在接线的时候要注意，我之前也是因为接线错误导致一个 HC05 蓝牙模块损坏。

stm32 定时器TIM时钟步骤

1）TIM3 时钟使能 。

RCC_APB1PeriphClockCmd(RCC_APB1Periph_TIMx, ENABLE); //时钟使能

2） 初始化定时器参数,设置自动重装值， 分频系数，计数方式等。

定时器的初始化函数TIM_TimeBaseInit

voidTIM_TimeBaseInit(TIM_TypeDef*TIMx,
TIM_TimeBaseInitTypeDef* TIM_TimeBaseInitStruct); //前面指是哪个TIM，后面指TimeBaseInitStruct结构体指针。

 

TIM_TimeBaseInitTypeDef  TIM_TimeBaseStructure;   //定义TIM初始化类型结构体变量

TIM_TimeBaseStructure.TIM_Period = 5000;   //设置自动重载计数周期值

TIM_TimeBaseStructure.TIM_Prescaler =7199;   //设置分频系数

TIM_TimeBaseStructure.TIM_ClockDivision = TIM_CKD_DIV1; //设置时钟分频因子

TIM_TimeBaseStructure.TIM_CounterMode = TIM_CounterMode_Up; //设置为向上计数方式

TIM_TimeBaseInit(TIMx, &TIM_TimeBaseStructure);  //初始化时钟TIMx

3） 设置 TIM3_DIER 允许更新中断 。

void TIM_ITConfig(TIM_TypeDef* TIMx, uint16_t TIM_IT, FunctionalState NewState)；
第一个参数是选择定时器号，这个容易理解，取值为 TIM1~TIM17。
第二个参数非常关键，是用来指明我们使能的定时器中断的类型，定时器中断的类型有很
多种，包括更新中断 TIM_IT_Update，触发中断 TIM_IT_Trigger，以及输入捕获中断等等。
第三个参数就很简单了， 就是失能还是使能 。

4） TIM3 中断优先级设置。 

 NVIC_InitStructure.NVIC_IRQChannel = TIM3_IRQn; //TIM3 中断
NVIC_InitStructure.NVIC_IRQChannelPreemptionPriority = 0; //先占优先级 0 级
NVIC_InitStructure.NVIC_IRQChannelSubPriority = 3; //从优先级 3 级
NVIC_InitStructure.NVIC_IRQChannelCmd = ENABLE; //IRQ 通道被使能
NVIC_Init(&NVIC_InitStructure); //④初始化 NVIC 寄存器
TIM_Cmd(TIM3, ENABLE); //⑤使能 TIM3 

5） 允许 TIMx工作，也就是使能 TIMx。 

void TIM_Cmd(TIM_TypeDef* TIMx, FunctionalState NewState) ;

6） 编写中断服务函数。 

 

在固件库函数里面， 用来读取中断状态寄存器的值判断中断类型的函数是：
ITStatus TIM_GetITStatus(TIM_TypeDef* TIMx, uint16_t) ;

固件库中清除中断标志位的函数是： 

 void TIM_ClearITPendingBit(TIM_TypeDef* TIMx, uint16_t TIM_IT) ;

 

例如：我们判断定时器3是否发生更新（溢出）中断，并清除中断标志位。

if (TIM_GetITStatus(TIM3, TIM_IT_Update) != RESET) {

　　TIM_ClearITPendingBit(TIM3, TIM_IT_Update ); 

}

//定时器 3 中断服务程序⑥
void TIM3_IRQHandler(void) //TIM3 中断
{
if (TIM_GetITStatus(TIM3, TIM_IT_Update) != RESET) //检查 TIM3 更新中断发生与否
{
TIM_ClearITPendingBit(TIM3, TIM_IT_Update ); //清除 TIM3 更新中断标志
LED1=!LED1;
}
}

Arduino Uno 采样速度



首先测试一下普通的 Arduino UNO 的采样速度

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:

void setup() {

  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:

  Serial.begin(9600);

  analogReference(INTERNAL); //调用板载1.1V基准源

}

 

void loop() {

  int i;

  float voltage;

  int sensorValue;

  unsigned long elsp=millis();

  for (i=0;i<10000;i++)

    {

      // read the input on analog pin 0:

      sensorValue = analogRead(A0);

    } 

  Serial.println(millis()-elsp);

  delay(10000);

}
 

运行结果是 1120 左右，就是说采样10000次用时1.12s，采样频率大约是 8928.57Hz (次/秒)。

找了一段代码【参考6】能够提高采样速度


// defines for setting and clearing register bits

#ifndef cbi

#define cbi(sfr, bit) (_SFR_BYTE(sfr) &= ~_BV(bit))

#endif

#ifndef sbi

#define sbi(sfr, bit) (_SFR_BYTE(sfr) |= _BV(bit))

#endif
 

写个程序测试一下


// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:

void setup() {

  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:

  Serial.begin(9600);

  analogReference(INTERNAL); //调用板载1.1V基准源

 

// set prescale to 16

sbi(ADCSRA,ADPS2) ;

cbi(ADCSRA,ADPS1) ;

cbi(ADCSRA,ADPS0) ; 

}

 

 

void loop() {

  int i;

  float voltage;

  int sensorValue;

  unsigned long elsp=millis();

  for (i=0;i<10000;i++)

    {

      // read the input on analog pin 0:

      sensorValue = analogRead(A0);

       

    } 

  Serial.println(millis()-elsp);

  delay(10000);

}
 

运行输出结果在 170 左右，就是说采样10000次用时0.170s，采样频率大约是 58823.53Hz (次/秒)。




原理上来说Arduino 的 ADC 是用一种逐次逼近比较的方法来进行ADC转换的。通俗的说就是内部有一个比较器，每次内部升高一个电压和外部指定的Pin进行比较，根据大于小于来判定外部指定脚上的电压。资料说做这样一个比较大约需要10次，13个机器周期。而比较的频率是主控频率分频给出来的，有一个分频因子，默认是128，分频因子越小，比较的速度也就越快。


1 2 3 speed
0 0 0 2
0 0 1 2
0 1 0 4
...   128


这里只是简单说一下，如果想了解ADC具体的工作原理，请阅读参考中提到的文章。


多说两句批评一下《Arduino技术内幕》这本书，刚开始我是阅读这本书来学习Arduino ADC的，但是阅读的时候感觉一直在外面游荡，不知道是原作者不懂还是翻译的人不明白，反正这一章的介绍让我一头雾水。

雖然 Arduino 的 analogRead( ) 預設的sampling rate 理論值是 9600 Hz,
接近 10KHz,
但這是因為 Arduino 的 ADC 之  Prescaler 被設為 128,
所以假設 Arduino 的時脈(Clock)是 16MHz,
則 ADC clock = 16MHz / 128 = 125KHz;
一次 ADC 轉換要踢它13下, 就是要 13 clock (tick),
於是變成 125KHz/13 = 9600Hz
不過那只是理論值, 因為你的程序本身也要花時間,
如果你用一個 for Loop 全力一直做 analogRead(A0),
那一秒鐘也只能讀取大約 8925 次, 達不到理論值 9600次 !!
不過,
Prescaler是可以改的!
把 ADC 的 Prescaler 改為 16,
則理論的 Sample Rate 可達 16MHz / 16 / 13 = 76.8KHz
但是實測只有大約 58KHz
若 ADC 的 Prescaler 改為 8,
則理論的 Sample Rate 可達 153KHz, 但實測只有大約93.5KHz
可是一般不建議把 Prescaler 設在 16以下, 否則ADC轉換不太準

以下是測試用 Prescaler 16, 採樣頻率 大約 58KHz

使用36-pin的STM32输出VGA
手头上有个项目需要通过单片机来控制将图像显示在LCD上，在网上搜了一阵子，发现都是使用的FPGA做的，

开始自己对FPGA不是很熟，一直在用的也是ARM系列的，终于让我找到一份至少现在看起来还是含金量蛮高的资料，

因为是英文的，这边先将它翻译一下（原文链接）。

 

　　想到之前玩的一些老的视频游戏和街机游戏（很早之前，大概70/80年代左右），脑子里浮现出一个想法：

如果在今天，我们是不是可以使用成本比较低的微控制器来实现之前玩玩的那些游戏呢？

这些微控制器设计的初衷并不是用来干这些事情的，所以问题也就产生了：

如何在使用很少或者不使用外部组件的情况下向显示器输出视频信号呢？

　　我们选择了36-pin, 72 MHz的STM32 (STM32F103T8U6),

足够用于产生黑白视频信号和点信号，同时还使用了一些定时器和SPI（在这种方式下更新帧缓冲是自动完成的），

在400*200分辨率的显示器上VGA输出视频信号看起来还是比较可观的。

使用的材料：

　　1 STM32F103T8U6开发板一块（或者同类型的开发板）。我们使用的是AK-STM32-LKIT。

　　2 VGA母口一个（DB15）

　　

虽然帧缓冲区是400*200的，但是输出的分辨率却是800*600（56hz刷新频率），

我们采用把横着点绘制两次，竖着的点绘制三次的方法来达到扩展分辨率的目的。

我们选择800×600 @ 56Hz的原因是因为像素时钟；

输出分辨率使用36MHz像素时钟，周期是72MHz的倍数（STM32的频率），

因为我们需要使用SPI产生像素信号，可以把STM32的频率经过SPI预分频得到18MHz的像素时钟，

然后将每一个像素点绘制两次，具体方法是当在水平方向800像素点时输出一个信号像素，

SPI 的 MOSI信号保持低电平或者高电平两倍的时间（相比于之前绘制一个点的时间）。

帧缓冲区是一个52×200字节的数组。每一行有50*8=400个像素（每一个bit是一个像素），

剩下的两个字节（52-50）模拟每一行的消隐间隔。

#define VID_VSIZE 200
#define VID_HSIZE 50
 
__align(4) u8 fb[VID_VSIZE][VID_HSIZE+2];
在这一块ram中写入的数据都会被输出到屏幕，DMA被设置为自动从数据缓冲区读取数据并且输出到SPI的MOSI引脚。

 

水平同步 　　

水平同步信号（ horizontal synchronism signal）和后延时间（back porch time）由TIM1定时器产生的通道1和2产生，TIM1定时器产生的通道1连接到PA8。



H-SYNC也就是TIM1定时器的通道1将会产生水平同步信号给显示器。

H-BACKPORCH也就是TIM1定时器的通道2,计算水平同步时间的和以及后延时间，

这个定时器产生一个中断用于触发DMA开始通过SPI发送像素的请求。

帧缓冲里面的每一行都会重复这样的过程，

垂直同步
TIM2定时器用于产生垂直同步信号，但是实在从机模式下。

TIM2计算主机（TIM1）产生的H-SYNC脉冲数。



TIM2的通道2通过PA1输出V-SYNC信号。

TIM2的通道3将会触发一个中断当定时器的计数器达到V-SYNC的和垂直后沿时间。

这个中断会设置一个变量表明正在扫描一个有效帧并且DMA可以开始发送像素到屏幕了。



像素发生器
像素由SPI的MOSI（PA7）产生。

定时器TIM1的通道2产生一个中断用于使能DMA TX请求向SPI发送数据。

DMA将会从帧缓冲区读取一行并且将数据放到SPI的DR寄存器。

DMA被设置用来在一行信号被发送之后产生一个中断，行号是递增的。

因为我们将每一行发送了三次，我们在中断中将计数加1。

当三行数据被发送出去，我们将DMA指针指向下一行的帧缓冲。

当所有的行被发送出去，DMA被禁止直到下一个有效单的帧中断发生（TIM2通道3）。

连接
你只需要几根杜邦线和一个母口的VGA接口就可以完成这项工作了。

VGA标准说输出信号应该在0.7V到1V之间，所以你需要在线上进行分压（串联68欧姆和33欧姆的电阻要比47pF和68欧姆的并联），

我们已经测试了一系列的LCD寄存器在没有分压的情况下，工作起来还行。

引脚发参考AK-STM32-LKIT扩展板接插件，引脚命名对于所有的STM32都有效。

根据你自己所用的STM32的手册确定使用的引脚是否一致。

我们使用绿色（VGA的引脚2）来模拟旧的那种显示效果，你可以使用其他的色彩方案使用

RED/GREEN/BLUE DB15引脚，可以创建8种颜色组合。





 

结论
　　我们使用了一个低成本微处理器作为VGA控制器，实现这个目的的方法很多，但是这种方法不需要额外的组件除了一个VGA接口。

　　如果你使用的是更高级的STM32，你可以试着使用扩大缓冲区而且在DMA被禁止的时候写帧缓冲区以避免数据被割裂。

　　你可以下载 源码，在里面你可以找到画线描点等等的工具库。

　　下一篇日志中会通过VGA样例来实现视频游戏。 

Space Invaders for STM32
Using the previous VGA output project, we have created this Space Invaders version for STM32.

The source code is kept as a separated project, but uses the same engine of the VGA output project.

Click here to download the source code.

Connections

We have added three push-buttons to the original connections.

These push-buttons serve as a joystick.

Here are the connections for the push-buttons and the VGA connector:



 

 

THANK YOU for sharing you project with us.

Your project was a starting point to our project.

I used your logic, rewritten whole code, expanded to 2 output SPI,

sinhronized them in slave mode using two more timers.

One to be same as TIM1, to trigger 10Mhz timer for SPI CLK.

I did additional logic with input part and viola an adapter on a MCU.

        Timer 1 channel 1 generates a 2 us pulse for HSYNC each 28.4 us. : D = ( 2 / 28.4 )
        28.4 us    = Visible area + Front porch + Sync pulse + Back porch.
        HSYNC is 2 us long, so the math to do is:
        2us / 0,0138us = 144 system ticks.
        
        Timer 1 channel 2 generates a pulse equal to HSYNC + back porch = 2 + 3.55 = 5.55
        This interrupt will fire the DMA request to draw on the screen if vflag == 1.
        Since firing the DMA takes more or less 800ns, we'll add some extra time.
        The math for HSYNC + back porch is:
        (2us + 3,55us - dma) / 0,0138us = +-350 system ticks

[讨论] STM32可以超频吗？

发表于 2014-12-19 20:03:35 




 在配置STM32的时钟的时候，像F103是72M，F429是180M，F4大部分是168M，改变时钟的配置让他超频行不行呢？是不是会不可靠？有没有人试过啊？
 等考完试了，好好地实验一下。看看F429能超到多少 。。。


 主要修改几个分频系数和倍频系数，比如说我把


  #if defined (STM32F427_437xx) || defined (STM32F429_439xx)

  #define PLL_N      400


 PLL_N改为400，把


  #if defined (STM32F427_437xx) || defined (STM32F429_439xx)

    uint32_t SystemCoreClock = 200000000;

  #endif /* STM32F427_437x || STM32F429_439xx */


  SystemCoreClock 改为200000000使用RCC_GetClocksFreq（）函数获取系统时钟可以看到  

 系统时钟变成了200MHz，所以说，超频很简单！

　　入夜了。

　　路边枯黄的野草隐入了黑暗里，老涛沉默地开着车，好像根本不存在一样。那个年纪轻轻，还带着公鸭声的男子不知从哪里拿出了一个橘子，剥开后大口地啃起来。

　　“你哪天被我抓拍到了，我一定会发遍全宇宙的！”邓秋离在一旁咯咯地笑着。

　　吃橘子为什么不剥成片呢？韩凌枫在一旁想着。

　　“我们是要去野外的某个磁场异常区域做调查！”他像没听到似的，一只手抓着橘子，兴奋地说，“你说野外为神马会突然出现磁场异常？我看最大的一种可能就是建军这货在那里搞什么实验！他是那种一不做二不休的人啊，总是在盘算着那些我们闻所未闻的东西，说不准这次他又冲刺了，已经在搞这种大规模的实验了。我看这次我们八成会遇到他，所以到时候我们破坏了他的设备赶紧跑路吧！”

　　一旁的维克多抬起头来看了看橘子男，边拿着平板边说：“我看这次我们八成不会遇到他。要造成这个大小的磁场，怕不是他一人一时半会儿就能弄出来的，我们倒是很可能碰到些研究气象的，我们要谨慎一点才好。”

　　“而真正可能对我们造成威胁的，是这个磁场本身，强大的磁场对人的神经、内分泌系统的影响很大，虽然不会马上对我们造成伤害，对在这样的磁场中待久了可能会发生些奇奇怪怪的事情。”

　　这时除了老涛，其他人都认真地听着维克多说话，橘子男还皱着眉头思考着，很自然，好像这是这支队伍的传统。

　　韩凌枫也被这种气氛所带动了，听着听着，他就想到了一些很可怕的事。

　　“人在强大的电磁场中若是呆得太久，就会出现晕厥、恶心、呕吐甚至是看到幻觉，影响情绪。比方说，在欧洲某国家有一个中世纪的地牢，据说被关到这个地牢内的犯人一段时间后就会看到鬼魂，大喊大叫，最后疯掉。后来科学家研究了那个地牢，并在那里发现了异常的磁场存在。”

　　虽然听起来觉得没有着落，但一想到自己那天突然的晕厥，就伴随着强烈的头痛，一想到父母那天反常的样子，韩凌枫只觉得头皮发麻，手臂上都起了鸡皮疙瘩。

　　这时，他发现维克多正在看着自己，那种很坦然的眼神。

　　“……在比方说，韩凌枫前几天连续两次遭到了这种攻击。”

　　虽然完全没有直接的证据，不过这种推论似乎是很符合逻辑的，韩凌枫一点都不怀疑，建军能做出来。

　　据说建军从小就玩电器，他的物理成绩又那么好，物理老师说，这孩子将来必成大器。

　　天哪……

　　维克多继续说：“我们也许会变得暴躁，也许会看到集体幻觉，我们不能在那里呆太长的时间，橘子男带个充电宝，把你的手机示波器一直打开，你和邓秋离负责对磁场的评估；我和老涛负责做标记，确定方向。”

　　“我们在距离磁场中心约五公里的地方下车，在确保安全的情况下，以最快的速度赶到磁场中央，得出一些结论，就撤了。”

　　“我们也许会遇到有蛇的丛林，或是庄稼地，湖，霸哥他们不在，我们要充分考虑，小心行事。”

　　然后维克多又看向韩凌枫。

　　“然后明天，我们把韩凌枫送到学校，继续处理建军的事。”

　　“话说，你作业怎么办？”

　　韩凌枫正在想着磁场的事，听到维克多问他，吓了一跳，随口说道：“没、没问题……我可以去复印一份……然后很快写完！”

　　随后大家又恢复了原来的状态，天空越发地黑得深沉，月光若隐若现，韩凌枫心头很是不安。

　　橘子男从他的包里拿出了一个笔记本电脑，连接上手机后就不停地鼓捣着，看来这厮还是个技术宅；而邓秋离就像考试作弊之前的学生一样，继续戳着她的粉红色壳iPhone。

　　维克多靠在车门边上沉思，像是一根标杆。

　　“维克多？”韩凌枫小声的喊他。

　　“怎么？”

　　“我能先去睡一会儿，一会和你们一起去吗？”

　　一想到在这样一个月黑风高的夜晚，自己要一个人呆在车上，这样的荒郊野岭，就像会闹鬼一般，韩凌枫不愿意呆在车上。

　　维克多想了一下，说：“其实这样最好，不过如果是野外，可能会不安全，你一会和老涛我们一组，你要小心野生动物、昆虫……”

　　“好的。”韩凌枫说，他之前已经觉得自己霸占着床位很不好意思，所以就直接躺在沙发上，而维克多看了看他，说：“你还是去后车厢吧。”

　　“我真的挺不好意思的……”

　　“你放心，我们一会儿会泡茶，而且那两货都是中午才醒的。现在快九点十几分，大约十二点到目的地，你去睡一会儿吧。

　　于是韩凌枫还是去了车厢，躺在那手术台一般的床铺上，安静地一动不动。这似乎是很有喜感的场景，但是韩凌枫这会儿是无论如何也笑不出来了。

　　心里满满的愧疚感，掺杂着恐慌感、好奇感，此刻他觉得自己腿都快抽搐了。

　　他又拿出手机充上，尽管他有意识地省电，但是这会儿也只有不到半格的电量了。

　　忽然，韩凌枫心头一动，登陆小学时候的扣扣账号，连续试了几次密码，又改密码、解冻之后，他又登陆了那个最初的扣扣号，盯着那些乱七八糟的昵称发呆。

　　那个签名上写着“梦想比条件更重要”老扣扣，从初中开始总是被盗的扣扣号。

　　这个账号很神奇，初中时被盗，有人在上面发奇奇怪怪的东西，韩凌枫果断改密码，随即又被盗，最后只得被迫换号。韩凌枫初中毕业时曾经又把它找了回来，但随后竟然有被盗了，于是韩凌枫彻底死心了，开通vip复制了好友，再也没有登录它了。

　　直到现在。

　　韩凌枫进入小学的扣扣群，翻到了邓秋离的名字，果然还是亮的，于是加好友。

　　“我是韩凌枫！”

　　几秒钟过后，请求被同意了，韩凌枫问道：“你不是出去读书了吗？”

　　然后他进了邓秋离的空间，看到里头很空，少量的说说很小清新，赞也是满满的，似乎除了自己所有人的赞都是满满的。

　　过了一会儿拉出一个对话框：“哟，韩凌枫！好久不见。就这样跟着我们走了，不怕自己肾被取掉啊？一点防备心都没有。”

　　看到这里，韩凌枫只觉得腰部一阵发凉，鸡皮疙瘩又起了，完全没有注意到对方根本没有回答自己的问题。

　　不过那种隐隐约约的危机感，似乎好了很多。

　　“额，一会儿请多关照哦！”

　　韩凌枫想了数分钟，终于憋出了这么一句话，惆怅着对方还会不会回话，自己要不要睡去。

　　几分钟过去了，没人回话，韩凌枫这才把手机丢在一边，把烦恼也扔在一旁，像是融在了夜色里，很快就睡着了。

　　而铁皮墙的另一边，维克多满脸严肃，心里渐渐地觉得不安。

　　李巫你们根本没有去之前说好的地方，你是在躲避着这里吗？

　　夜色中公路是这样的漫长，开着车灯都没有把握，也不知过了多久，异变发生了！

　　整辆车突然开始微微颤抖，随后越来越剧烈，好像这块大铁皮都要被撕开了！

　　韩凌枫突然被惊醒了，连思考的时间都没有，脸就被一旁的台灯撞到了。

　　车祸？！

　　还是地震？？

　　随后这震动强到了不可思议的程度，韩凌枫从床上被撞到天花板上，又摔下来，头撞到墙上，晕过去了。

　　“我醉倒在海边，一如万年前的清晨。”

　　——《祭祀手札》第五卷，吟游诗人与海女

　　朱梓翻动书架，灰尘漫无天际地弥散开来，这是一本开本不太大的书，书名已经看不清了，纸面粗糙，泛黄，且带着手工制品的杂乱花纹，但整体来看却非常精致，作者像个父亲一样细心。

　　全书都是手写的，毛笔字很娟秀，可韩凌枫不知道它讲的是什么。

　　除开部分繁体字，大多都是韩凌枫熟悉的简体，可内容相当乱来，似梦非梦，内容也不连贯，可它散发着一种忧愁，一种像蓝宝石般黯淡的光，让人心疼，让人想要保护它。

　　“没人知道这些是在讲什么，比如这一篇…”朱梓小心地翻开一页。

　　“受难者的灵魂，

　　会与施难者的

　　相连接。

　　恶鬼由此，

　　重返人间。”

　　完全没逻辑，恶鬼什么的，是不存在的吧，你说那些个相信神话的人都在想什么？

　　“看这里！”朱梓翻到很特殊的一页，比别的都更细致，是很用心地写下的。

　　内容大概是说在天外还有一个世界，那里住着神明，他们被贬下凡间的神渐渐失去了力量，成了人。

　　书中说，神界比凡间好得太多，无忧无虑。

　　韩凌枫这种神棍的东西也看得很多，但这么古老的文字他是第一次见到。

　　仔细咀嚼着书中的每个字，可他仍不觉得这其中有什么必然的联系。

　　朱梓是认为我所来的地方就是所谓“神界”吧？可那太缥缈了，可以说有，也可以说没有。

　　朱梓看了看韩凌枫，兴奋地说到:“可这是古书《祭祀手札》啊，是圣贤道子所作。最聪明的人，只会留下些疯言疯语吗？”

　　这倒是说服了韩凌枫，这时朱梓祭司的特质就表现出来了。

　　韩凌想起刚刚回来时，看到老涛睡着了，他没什么大碍，恢复得不错，这些事情要更实在得多。

　　朱梓思考了一阵，认真地看着韩凌枫:“据说，道子先生曾经是一位神。”

　　韩凌枫想着想着忽然想通了，冷汗冒了出来。

　　试想，外界的科学发现更快，外界的人能进入这里，那么外界的人若是带着知识进入这里，就很可能会成为鹤立鸡群的人物。

　　朱梓努力回忆着，继续说到:“据记载，道子先生住在地下，他思考时所留下的痕迹也都在那里，谁能到那个地方，谁就能理解神的力量，理解这个世界的一切。”

　　韩凌枫发现这种版本自己也是听过的，但是这种感觉却很不一样，之前朱梓的思路都在那里，你不得不承认它可能存在。

　　“若是神的遗迹真的存在，并且掌握了它就能使人也过上神的生活，那么寻找这个地穴一定是很重要的事情，不亚于庞大的工程，”朱梓使劲闭着眼睛，思考着，“我知道，祭司是占卜的人，可我从未觉得占卜，真的有用，而占卜却是必须的。若是她们都在那里解读道子所留，这样就说得通了！”

　　韩凌枫发现朱梓这时候的思路真是很难跟上，怪不得聪明如她也会愁成那个样子。

　　朱梓见韩凌枫并没有明白自己的意思，激动地拉过来一大张纸，蘸了毛笔画了一个圈。

　　“这是整个村子，背面靠着坡，”她说着，把圈的上半部分涂黑了，“而下半圈是勇士的营地。”

　　“在圈内，上半部分是作坊、农户;下半部分则是武器坊、训马场、摔跤场以及，酋长的主营地。”

　　朱梓把圈内上下都涂上了淡淡的墨色，好像一潭湖水，最后，她把一滴浓墨滴在正中央。

　　“祭坛，才是村子的中心。”

　　夜里，朱梓和韩凌枫来到祭坛，韩凌枫用手机照明，光线昏暗。

　　“我这可只能照明一会儿，橘子男回来了才有办法充电，谁知道他们还不回来。”

　　和朱梓绕过几个农户，他们看到了那个建在高地上的祭坛，巨大的石板铺成台阶，庄严又神圣。

　　这里的黄昏也是橘红色，夜风凉凉的，却没有意料中那么寒冷。

　　朱梓穿着那件豹皮衣裳，显得很高挑，她不习惯，似乎很害羞。

　　手机的节能彩屏不足以照亮祭祀室，朱梓凭着记忆四处观察着。

　　“因为只有这儿才有一条河，部落的位置始终没过，地窖一定是在这里。”

　　韩凌枫看着角落里的杂物，越看越像某些奇怪的东西，不由得感到恐惧。

　　忽然想起顾小蔓，那个女孩子疯疯癫癫的，胆子也比自己大，说要去夜店也是她提出的，就像分手也是她提出的。

　　她是那种总是能找到朋友的人——除了自己别的人都能找到更好的人。

　　而如今，男孩不再回你想让他看到的说说，不再装呆发消息逗你笑，他不再给你发消息，你知道的，你们分手了。

　　顾小蔓没有人陪的时候，韩凌枫还热心地祝她生日快乐，尽管后来搞砸了。

　　朱梓对自己很友好，可他总会想起顾小蔓，一想起顾小蔓，他就只能像孤单的月亮一样傻站着。

　　“祭司们每天要进入地窖解读遗迹，又不能让别人发现，那它一定在一个没人敢去的地方。”

　　朱梓一边说，一边对着祭祀台跪了下来，找到了一个青石暗门，她使劲一扯，打开了它，密道深不见底，残缺的石台阶还很湿润。

　　祭祀台上的兽骨，在黑暗里让人毛骨悚然。

　　韩凌枫想，这和顾小蔓最后给他的感觉是一样的，像一只隐藏在黑暗里的蜘蛛，由于饥饿而嗜血。

　　刚认识的那年冬天，她穿着彩色的棉袄站在跑道边，像一颗饱满富贵的玛瑙石。

　　这样想来，顾小蔓长大后会很富贵吧，也许她会成为一个贵妇，她的妈妈在医院工作，她初一钢琴八级，他哥哥送了她一台高大上的iPad……

　　她后来若是成了权倾一方的人物，我就躲得远远的;若是她孤独终老，我就去看她，讲笑话给她听。

　　韩凌枫想，反正我自己就是个天大的笑话就是了。

　　他们走进了阴暗潮湿的地窖，朱梓兴奋得双手颤抖着。韩凌枫的手机闪光灯始终亮着光，光芒洁白又刺目。

　　墙壁是凿出来的，韩凌枫看着那些古老的纹路，忽然又想起刚遇到维克多时，被狗血地闪了一下，你看维克多也不是完美的呀，闪你妹啊，他是慌了莫非？

　　也许是让自己慌了？

　　不想了，还影响别的事。

　　韩凌枫偶尔被石壁上出现的壁虎之类吓到，在十几米深处，他们来到了一条不见尽头的长廊。

　　韩凌枫手机灯光一招，心都被揪紧了。

　　墙壁上画着怪物、烈火、盘曲的巨龙，天崩地裂，世界末日！

　　二零零五年，“洛克”中东地下堡垒。

　　一个瘦黑的平凡男孩正在吃饭，他的脸有些黑不过很平整，看上去朴实无华。

　　他的动作很小不过很到位，他面无表情，像是在嚼蜡。

　　他的周围还有别的孩子，他们整齐地坐着吃饭，几乎没人说话。

　　偶尔有女孩议论他:“说不定建军哪天会自杀呢……”

　　尽管每个人都非常骄傲，还是有很多女孩都暗地里对建军有好感，因为建军是个谜。

　　他们有的修量子力学，有的修基因工程，不过建军似乎都会;他们有的已经成为互联网上游荡的幽灵，有的善于设计能量武器，不过建军总能让他们感到不如。

　　他们都是洛克“深蓝”计划的对象，十多年前，洛克秘密进行的人类基因组计划完成后，居住于地底的科学家们提出了人脑改良项目，“深蓝”就代表使用基因手段从根本上提高人类智力。

　　此前，洛克秘密地收集了世界上高智商人群的基因，爱因斯坦、达芬奇、耶稣、黄帝……以及一些从未透露过姓名的民间智者基因，尽管很多因为年代久远已经不完整，还是最终得到了若干份基因组。

　　对于这样一个秘密的无耻的组织，人类的克隆他们早在国际法禁止之前就搞出来了，这也是洛克“永生”计划的一部分。

　　二零一三年五月四日

　　火光隐隐地摇晃着，在建军的脸上勾勒出阴影，这里有些成堆的兽骨龟甲、竹简书籍，这里是大祭司的房间。

　　“太久了。”建军说。

　　一旁的大祭司悄悄地问道:“先生？”

　　七年前，“深蓝”计划的最终实验，建军以所有成绩全优而脱颖，他的各方面都很完美，虽然话不多看上去有些孤僻，不过这看上去并不是缺点。

　　他获得了一份奖品，在那个时候，绝对的，甚至唯一的尖端技术产物。

　　奖品被放在一个盒子里，所有人都小心地对待它，看上去那里头的东西就值了半个“深蓝”计划。

　　二零一三年五月四日，朱梓韩凌枫在地窖里，眼前是一条看不到尽头的长廊，墙壁上画着末日的预言。

　　他们的心跳才正要平静下来，忽然楼梯口传来很多人的声音，朱梓连忙拉着韩凌枫朝走廊里跑去，可那黑暗中却出现了一个人影。

　　那时，有火光照亮了一切黑暗，眼前的人强壮又威严，那黑色的眼睛里带着一种强烈的敌意。

　　韩凌枫看向身后，部落的勇士们已经堵住了他们，那些强壮的身躯像是捕猎的野兽。

　　“大酋长……”朱梓喃喃。

　　恶臭袭人，老鼠在角落里乱窜，韩凌枫忽然想到络上那个鼻子被咬掉的女孩，于是颤抖着坐了起来。

　　他被关在了一个地牢，用石头堆砌成了墙，门用巨石堵着，只留下一个小窗。说来很奇怪，因为这个地牢的结构比地面的房屋更进步。不过，道子的地窖是在一块石头上生生凿出来的，比起这些，地牢在这里还算正常的。

　　韩凌枫觉得这次自己逃不掉了，他在教师办公室出生入死无数次，在医院输液打针无数次，还在高原上喘不过气来，可从未闻到过这样的血腥味。

　　他心神恍惚，双脚颤抖，内心充满了恐惧，他忽然觉得这次会不会走不出去了，他忽然很想鲜花的味道，曾经每天早晨吃的早餐都是美好的。

　　朱梓在走廊尽头嘶吼着，那种语言中的情绪气味让每个人都心碎，韩凌枫听着听着就哭了。

　　他看过了，这地牢很窄，狭长的走廊里还关很多人，他们大多都饿得半生不死的，浑身肮脏充满了排泄物的味道，安静得像不存在一样，看着韩凌枫和朱梓。

　　不知时间过了多久。

　　韩凌枫忽然想到一个主意，动画片中海尔兄弟用火灼烧巨石，又撒尿冷却它，在热胀冷缩下巨石就碎裂了。

　　这是因为石头中各种杂质热膨胀系数不同，热胀时某些点受力较大崩裂，然后冷缩时裂缝又扩大开来，这是可能实现的。

　　地牢中很多稻草可以用作燃料，可他没有火源。砸石头摩擦起火？这些石头不是火石没可能的；然后他又想到手机电池短接也许能引火，可这样又太缥缈了，没有铜线。

　　他没办法了，洞口的巨石看上去得五六个人才能勉强挪开，洞里很干净，没东西可以砸。

　　他再一次陷入了绝望。

　　不知过了多久，朱梓不再吼叫，韩凌枫呆楞在原地。

　　“你是猴子请来的救兵吗？”

　　这时他的手机竟然响了，这里可是没信号的！

　　他颤抖着拿起电话，只见屏幕上方显示信号有两格。

　　奇迹！韩凌枫接听了电话，电话里传来橘子男的声音。

　　“你在哪儿？”

　　“牢里！”

　　电话里沉默了一会儿，问道:“在哪个位置？我们怎么救你出来？”

　　韩凌枫说:“门口有个接近一吨的石头，地牢在祭坛背后！”

　　然后对方挂掉了电话，韩凌枫感到一阵心悸，不知道对方怎样了。

　　又过了不知多久，问口的守卫换了三班，忽然愣住了，然后被什么东西击中了，有个瘦削矫健的人影跑来，扶住了昏迷的部落守卫。

　　远处另一个守卫听到了，谨慎地冲了过来，看样子要攻击正半蹲下的维克多。

　　守卫很强壮的，维克多敌不过的。

　　可他手里握住了一个什么东西，随着“刺啦”一声，那守卫倒下了。

　　韩凌枫趴在洞口看着，橘子男一瘸一拐地跑了过来，把一根登山绳的一头拴在巨石上，另一头拴在对面。

　　然后他背着维克多，让他站在绳上，维克多平衡很好，竟然站住了。

　　韩凌枫会意了，这是根据平行四边形法则，借用了绳子的张力，他开始全力推石头，肚子很饿，但他想尽了一切办法增大推力。

　　橘子男拿出一根长长的铁棍子，开始撬动巨石，这是利用杠杆原理，借用了铁棍的弹力。

　　虽然很想杂技团，不过三力相加，巨石被移动了。

　　韩凌枫逃出来了，他们又救出了朱梓。

　　“按着以前的一个想法，橘子男模拟了信号塔的信号，还加大了天线的功率，这才找到你。”维克多说。

　　“不便一一细说了，我们看到建军了，他知道这里的存在，说不好是他发布任务把我们给引来的，当时我们……入不敷出了。”

　　“你们先走吧，战斗开始了，不是发泄脾气、争个对错的打架斗殴，这是用尽全力的，要去用一切能碰到的力量去打倒对方的斗争，为了生存！”

　　韩凌枫知道自己帮不上什么忙，可朱梓得知人们似乎已经听从建军的号令了，有些希望留下来。

　　后来他们还是决定躲起来，朱梓不说话，韩凌枫时不时看这些自己瘦削的手臂，看着那“恶意”。

　　因为它总在手臂上飘来飘去，韩凌枫想把它拴起来，可太挤，最后他还是没管它，看上去很神奇。

　　没有外人看到时还是常常拿出来。

　　夜幕像一潭幽幽的湖水，丛林里乱枝很多，韩凌枫很累，可却不停地跑，好像那已经不是他的脚。

　　静…

　　“我在等他跟我道歉。”

　　海伦·伊丽莎白，墓志铭

　　一

　　很多天过去了，很多天了，韩凌枫和朱梓浑身都是泥。

　　韩凌枫的良心不允许他看着朱梓就这样不行了。

　　朱梓是个很善良，很孤单的女孩子呀。

　　可是没有办法了，谁知道这个世界竟然如此冷漠。

　　这里的树很多，可完全不结果实。

　　朱梓带着韩凌枫掘出这些大树的根系，偶尔能找到土豆一般的瘤状根，朱梓在夜里没有湿气时钻木取火，将它烤熟了吃。

　　在这里钻木取火是非常困难的，因为湿气的缘故，树木都长得很柔软，常常一两天都不能成功。

　　而且他们迷路了，面对虫、泥、蝙蝠，他们再回去也不可能了。

　　饿得神智不清时，韩凌枫会想起顾小曼。

　　顾小曼也是有苦衷的吧，韩凌枫知道顾小曼也很孤单，她的说说空荡荡的，像自己一样。

　　即使她的确伤害了自己，那也没多大事儿呀。

　　世界原本残酷，温馨舒适其实是人们的心愿。

　　为此，人们努力着让生活更好。

　　只能期待维克多和橘子男找到自己了，可他们的麻烦更是不小呀。

　　需要帮助的总是自己，可同伴们遇到困难时自己什么忙也帮不上。

　　韩凌枫又想起建军。

　　自己为什么这么畏惧建军呢？

　　从一开始，他就不在乎任何人。

　　建军像只黑色的刺猬，他一双眼睛看尽你的所有，他在黑暗中袭击你。

　　然后你的所有反抗只会撞击到那些尖刺。

　　你什么都没有，血流成河。

　　韩凌枫很早就认定了，建军可以打破一切记录，可以让每个人敬畏他，但他绝不可能让自己妥协了，，绝不！

　　不过现在看来这也摇摇可危了，建军已经将触手伸向了脑科学。

　　他是男神体质，什么都能成功，他学会了知识，为了避嫌不告诉任何人。

　　…………

　　韩凌枫只觉得泪水都要涌出来了。

　　不知道几天过去了，韩凌枫忽然想起了什么。

　　“朱梓…你说道子先生是部落的先祖，生于几百年前的洪荒。”

　　“嗯。”朱梓喃喃。

　　韩凌枫欲言又止，斟酌了很久，说：“既然他是我们那边来的，也是来自很繁华的封建时代了，可手工技术一点没保留下来呀。”

　　朱梓愣住了。

　　“制造工具，毫不费力干活呀。”韩凌枫补充道。

　　朱梓愣了一下，说道：“因为在纷争中被唾弃了。”

　　“哦？”

　　“在古书中说，道子生前始终都在传播这些知识，可都失败了。”

　　韩凌枫愣了一下，然后说：“这有什么困难吗？”

　　朱梓回忆了一下，道：“我也不知道，所有古籍都没有提到这些。不过据说道子先生临终前把自己关在石头地窖里，留下了一本书，它被称为《祭司手札》的「密卷」，只有历代大祭司才知道它在哪里。”

　　“以前我不敢，不过这次我们要是活下来了，我们就把它弄出来看看吧。”朱梓笑着。

　　“好。”韩凌枫道。

　　若是活下去，还是可以有真正的生活的，那种干净每天都有热水的生活。

　　以前韩凌枫会想，生活就是你有双很漂亮白色的帆布鞋，你有件很潇洒的线衣，你想着和那个女孩擦肩而过时，你要穿着那双白色的帆布鞋，你要穿得像个干净的邻家男孩，你从阳光下走过，下过雨的灌木和花瓣上粘着晶莹的水珠。

　　你一头柔顺懒散的头发，午觉还没睡饱。

　　这就是你的计划了，她来的那天，天空都颠倒了，但是你的鞋还装着臭袜子晕倒在床下，你的衣服下肥肉露了头，你想做什么都失败了，你被挟持了，你瞬间就成为了世界上最傻冒的人。

　　生活就是这样，生活一直都是这样，就像一片地狱，它让你心痛，直到有一天你习惯了这种痛苦，你的鞋就再也洗不干净了。

　　只不过离开得太久了，韩凌枫自动把内涵都忘了。

　　回去，什么都好。韩凌枫想着。

　　二

　　后来，朱梓逮住一只兔子，那兔子惊疑不定地望着两人，朱梓蒙上它的眼睛，木然地把兔子宰杀了。

　　韩凌枫在一旁看着，忽然想起自己帮助家人宰鸡的情景。

　　朱梓看了一眼韩凌枫，叹息道：“活着，就是与痛苦作伴呀。”

　　刚下了雨，没能生火，朱梓咬开兔皮，扬起头，喝兔血。

　　忽然间韩凌枫感到头皮发麻，脖颈一阵恶寒，自己竟然和她一起饿了这么多天。

　　现在自己非常饿，竟然也有种想要充饥的感觉。

　　朱梓将那兔子递给韩凌枫，似乎在询问。

　　有寄生虫吧？不过性命都快不保了，也不算什么大碍了。

　　韩凌枫犹豫了一下，然后喝了一点，那是一种温热的腥味，又粘稠，有股生鱼身上的那种味道。

　　然后朱梓茹毛饮血般地吃下了兔肉，韩凌枫也吃下了一些，感觉这次吃的比前半辈子都多。

　　那味道像是某种充斥着温热鱼腥味的橡皮果冻。

　　第二天韩凌枫拉了一整天肚子，几乎脱水。

　　韩凌枫虚弱地躺着，觉得自己快死了。

　　“你……”朱梓无奈地看着他，她眼里的韩凌枫就像一片雪花，简直脆弱得不行。

　　“我还以为我就是全世界身体最弱的人了。”朱梓喃喃道。

　　三

　　两人就这样行尸走肉般地走着，眼前出现一条河。

　　“月亮河！”朱梓喊到：“我们竟然转回来了。”

　　“这是村子门口那条河？”韩凌枫问。

　　“是的。”朱梓说。

　　“这是这世上唯一一条河，据说她有种神奇的魔力，会让迷路的人找到她，很模糊的传说了，以前我还不信。”

　二零一三年五月三日，午间

　　男孩独自在车厢里，看着面前那个黑色简约的手表，它竟然悬浮在桌上，韩凌枫伸手去触碰，可是指尖一旦凑近，那没有屏幕的手表就好像在躲避着韩凌枫的手一样，漂浮着躲开了。

　　仿佛有一种斥力。

　　之前韩凌枫的第一反应是，那是他们在玩他呢，利用磁场，使一块磁铁悬浮起来，不算难度很大的事情，但是渐渐地他发现事情不是那么回事。

　　无论是什么样的东西，只要接近了“恶意”，它们就会受到相反的力量，相互排斥。

　　而且，这种力量在随着那个物体的重量增大而增大。

　　韩凌枫虽然不是最优秀的学生，但好歹也算完成了九年义务教育，这样的事若他不是亲眼看到，是绝对不会相信的。

　　韩凌枫此前从未亲眼见过这样的东西，唯一曾听说的就是UFO有反重力罩，可这样的事情怎么可能是真的？所以早就不了了之了。

　　他觉得自己头皮都麻了，之前维克多说他们都是一个叫OFU的组织成员，难不成，这两者之间有联系？

　　维克多不像骗子，虽然也不能排除这种可能，但是一群牛到没有听说过的人，又跟UFO扯上了关系，韩凌枫忽然觉得维克多多多少少与UFO有着一定的关系，而且这一车人都不太对头，总之与韩凌枫在校时看到的那三五成群的学生不同，又和那些有着正经工作的人也不同，好像他们都是外星人，要拿自己做研究似的。

　　否则，你要怎么解释邓秋离、维克多、建军这些变态会凑到一块儿？

　　莫不是，他们发现了新的科技吧？虽说现在的科技似乎已经不是那么容易就能有所突破的，但是谁知道呢？像奥斯特发现了电流磁效应，也不是偶然吗？

　　建军他们，和自己年龄差不多，甚至比自己还要小，却已经开始接触自己完全不能理解的东西了吗？

　　原来建军比自己想得还要天才，他在外面结交了一群天才朋友，他们发现了反重力效应，而今加入甚至是成立了这个即将崛起的科技公司，OFU，它在未来会像苹果、腾讯那样强大，家喻户晓。

　　是的，这是非常合乎逻辑的解释了。

　　可是自己呢？

　　在对建军有所了解之前，韩凌枫才是寝室的室长，自己的身高是最高的，那么善良没有一点恶意，虽然与室友们玩得很开，却忽略了室长的责任。

　　后来建军来了，作为新的室长。

　　建军是一个什么样的人呢？他所有的衣服、生活用品都带着单调的颜色，他从不多说一句话，他每天晚上安静得像是死了一样，只有当大家聊了一会儿后，他才会用很没有感情的语调吼着不要说话，而大家都会听话的。

　　韩凌枫一直以来觉得自己是生在一个小城市，从没想过做什么世界上独一无二的人。什么十四岁就创业的人好像不过是外国的特产。

　　可是突然很失落，像是胸膛里一朵鲜花破碎了，让人很心疼。

　　怎么可以这样，自己不是经常看到很多充满信心的东西吗？

　　不是说什么梦想不设限，不是说什么上帝会为你打开另一扇窗，不是说什么我们平等地站在上帝面前？

　　自己为什么会这样弱小，好像一只瘸了腿的羊羔。

　　看着面前转着圈的“恶意”，韩凌枫忽然很想砸了它。

　　这时传来了沉稳的脚步声，有人踏进了车门，维克多走了进来。

　　“怎么样，它很神奇吧？我忽然觉得跟你很合适呢。”

　　“恶意是建军我们以前偶然得到的，经过了严格的分析却得不到结论，好像它内部就是普通的铁。”

　　“后来我们拿它没办法了，于是就做成了手表，我叫它‘恶意’，是很有纪念意义的东西，暂时送给你吧。”

　　观察着那黑色塑胶表带的样子，韩凌枫戴上了那手表，表带很舒适，很酷，而且他曾经就把网名改成过“恶意”，有一种亲切感，真的很好。

　　没有重量，就像一滴水，还会在手腕上滑来滑去。

　　“我想了一下，决定告诉你更多的事。”维克多坐下，看了看韩凌枫，然后从包里拿出了一个ipad。

　　对韩凌枫来说，苹果是高级的东西，几年前就听说了，也偶尔会看到，但是他从来没曾想自己会这么近距离地接触它。

　　“真的不希望我们之间有任何误解，所以还是要你看看这个。”

　　维克多打开浏览器，输入了一个网址，打开的时候，屏幕上好像有个果冻在蹦跶。

　　这是一个很简洁的网站，标题上写着“OFU”几个懒散的字母，整个内容似乎是一张还未完成的图画，像是丛林深处的一片小空地。

　　哈？这什么意思？这是个美术小组？

　　维克多看了看韩凌枫，说：“这是一个隐秘组织，其成员散布在世界各地，虽说寥寥数万，可他们全都是高精尖的人才，如果你有很多奇思妙想，来这里找帮手就对了。”

　　“具有一定声誉的用户可以发布任务，如果具有一定的能力和信用，也许就能成为专职的成员。”

　　“访客不能注册账号，每个人都是在机缘巧合下才成为了会员。”

　　维克多点了点图上那些树，然后打开了一个全新的页面，像是一个论坛，有很多帖子的那种。

　　韩凌枫看着那些帖子的标题，其内容让人头皮发麻。

　　“【悬赏】X州车站骗子清理。”

　　“【招募】细胞化学，分析师。”

　　“【招募】中山路眼线。”

　　“【出售】手制型运载无人机。”

　　…………

　　维克多快速地点进了一个界面，那里有一条消息，屏幕上显示着未读。

　　“【招募整队】江城天气异常调查（新）。”

　　点开它，其中有一条简短的消息，一份地图和一些表格。

　　“任务分配，调查江城郊外的磁场异常，并写一份详尽的报告。”

　　韩凌枫觉得那真心不像是开玩笑的，那份地图非常详细，就是江城附近的地图，表格的目录上大部分是些他还看不懂的符号，而且最近天气确实很反常甚至完全不像教科书中描述的那样。

　　韩凌枫开始真正相信维克多所说的话了。

　　“有时某些公司，或者单位，他们的人手不够，就会试着在这个网站上雇佣某些够资历的人，通常老鸟不会愿意和他们打交道，因为难度较大。不过由于他们有完整的资料，而且有时甚至能得到那个组织的一些内部资料，还是有人会铤而走险。”

　　韩凌枫眼睛不觉得瞪得很大，看着屏幕：“我玩游戏这么多年从不知道还有这样的网站……”

　　“这事儿你最好别说出去，”维克多幽幽地说：“毕竟我们也不是干坏事的。”

　　“而且网络，并不是OFU存在的主要形式。他们能看出你是否知道自己的秘密。”

　　“怎么会？”

　　“比方说我一提到OFU你就会做出这种表情……”

　　下午了，所有人出发了，那个叫“老涛”的中年人在开车，那个年轻男子站在他身后，互相调戏着。

　　而维克多站在一旁，只有邓秋离坐在座位上。

　　邓秋离和韩凌枫搭了一两句话，就开始弄手机，邓秋离拿着粉红色外壳的iphone，戳来戳去，维克多则沉默地看着前车窗。

　　韩凌枫不知道自己要干什么。

　　忽然，维克多的手机响了，传来清脆的铃声，他拿出一款白色的三星手机，看了看。

　　“咋了？“邓秋离问。

　　“没事。”维克多说，他顿了顿，又说，“青洒的生日。”

　　然后所有人都沉默了，韩凌枫很好奇这个青洒是谁。

　　维克多说今晚就能到那个磁场异常的地区，应该明天就能完事儿。

　　于是韩凌枫就听着音乐，看着窗外的天空越来越暗，最后漆黑一片，只有一轮皎洁的明月，高高地挂在天空中。

　　当天亮起来的时候，温度也升高了，寒气开始褪去，天空渐渐变成了蓝色。

　　朱梓告诉韩凌枫和维克多两人，说妈妈为他们准备了食物，于是他们要去叫上正在房间里进行生产活动的橘子男，以及已经在等他们的邓秋离。

　　这是一间建得很细心的木屋，房间里堆了好几个箱子，全都打开着，全是零件，工具，还有一些小型设备，围成了个圈。这些是昨天累死累活才搬来的，橘子男正顶着一头油亮的头发，盘坐在那扇形中间，叼着一袋咖啡粉，神采奕奕地盯着他们。

　　“奇迹啊，喂我告诉你们我干了个通宵，我们穿越了…”橘子男指着他面前那台笔记本电脑，睁大眼睛盯着他们，激动得几乎手舞足蹈。

　　他们走过去，看到橘子男的电脑上显示着数个镜头，看上去是他遥控的飞行物。

　　韩凌枫被吓住了，他此前亲眼见过的顶多也只是熬了一晚游戏就像腌了一样的人，而这时橘子男看上去是打了鸡血，马上要蹦起来了。

　　“去吃饭。”维克多一脸严肃地看着他。

　　“额…”橘子男一看似是觉得这货态度极硬，便转向了韩凌枫，“这是我的机器人大军噢，无线电通讯，有太阳能补给的航母，运载机，半自动侦察机，工人机器人，可以连接到我的手机和电脑哦，未来拓展到智能眼镜上也不是不可能哟！”

　　韩凌枫很想回避他们在哪儿的问题，可觉得自己给朱梓一家带来了很多麻烦，于是还是问起这事儿来，后来对未知事物的神秘感觉完全把他吸引住了。

　　维克多却在一旁陷入了回忆，这是橘子男从高中时就开始设计的东西，从零件到芯片全是他自己弄的，橘子男在一旁用显微镜尝试雕刻芯片，维克多就在一旁优雅地恶心他，说橘子男的机械太丑，要设计成人形的才好。而工人机器人的设计就是来自这里。

　　后来他们认识了邓秋离，邓秋离就一直吵着要把机器人做成球形的云云。

　　维克多叫住了橘子男，朱梓她们还在等。另外，他们现在该关心这村子的情况了。

　　在曙光下的村子有一种细致而错杂的美感，看上去有近千人的样子，这些建筑都围绕着一个更高的山坡，那山坡上建这一座颇为原始又大气的巨石建筑，是祭祀用的。

　　这些东西虽然美，却带着一种恐惧感，因为它们完全不像是现实世界的。

　　朱梓笑笑，说她的妈妈就是那里的祭司。

　　食物是一只烤羊大腿，水果，泉水和一些面饼，都是手工收集的。盛放食物的是木板、瓷碗，陶瓷上画着很细致的彩画，有的是成群结伙的人，有的是花鸟、动物。虽说那画工已经超过原始社会的陶彩，而接近于青花瓷一类，从而趋近于现代的风格了，不过看那手工制作的精细，很明显这是一个处于半原始半封建的，与世隔绝的社会。

　　这是一件相当恐怖的事请，直让一行人头皮发麻，后背起鸡皮疙瘩，韩凌枫甚至手脚都有些发抖。不过现在明显不是讨论这事儿的时候，大家也只是沉默了。

　　朱梓与众人聊了一会天，朱梓说母亲很少在家，他还有几个婆婆，但她们住在河对岸，祭坛的另一端，平时很少见面的。

　　这些，就是朱梓的全部亲人了。

　　而他们的到来，也被部族的王、长老们知晓了，他们要见众人。

　　通过朱梓的介绍，大家渐渐对这个部族有了些了解，这里最重要的三个势力就是酋长、长老会和祭司们。祭司主要涉及文化方面的事情，长老会与酋长是作政治决定的人，比如决定扩张、移民，不过长老会才是真正着手处理的人，酋长的形象更多则是战士们的精神领袖，所有的男人们都从听他的号令。

　　这样看来的话，政治水平是比最初的封建社会强上不少的…维克多想着。

　　最后，一个成年男子带维克多三人去见长老，韩凌枫和朱梓回去照顾受伤较重的老潘。

　　路过一片空地时，韩凌枫看到几个精干的男生还狠狠地瞪了他一眼，这让韩凌枫感到不舒服。

　　“那人，最讨厌了。”朱梓说。

　　又回到了朱梓的家，朱梓向韩凌枫介绍了满屋的乐器、书籍，韩凌枫一时说不出话来，朱梓想了想，说：“我家的书是村子里最多的哦！”

　　“虽然大多都很无聊…”看到韩凌枫已经愣住了，朱梓嘟囔道。

　　过了好一会儿，韩凌枫忽然觉得朱梓的生活似乎少了些什么，他才问：“那你和你朋友们，平时玩些什么呢？”

　　“…”朱梓呆了好一会儿，然后说，“领居家有只长不大的小狗狗，白色的，我会经常喂它，它是我的好朋友。”

　　“可妈妈说，这样的狗永远比不得人，它们只知道趴在你身边，但有一天你若是走了，它会很可怜的。”

　　朱梓继续说着，声音越来越小。

　　不能同行，乃人生一大悲剧。

　　韩凌枫看着这个女孩，他之前所有的伤痛、疏远感、危险感全都消失了，这使他感到如此亲近。

　　“我们是从别处来的，我们那儿的人什么都能做出来，吃饱穿暖更是不成问题，我可以带你们去的。”韩凌枫忽然说。

　　可是他又感到如此弱小，他自己在城市里又算哪根葱呢？

　　“外面的人！”朱梓却忽然有些激动，起身在书柜里翻找着，“有一本古书里记载过，如果那是真的…”

　　朱梓从书柜里翻出一本老旧得发黄的线装书，看上去是用某种植物的细根装订的。

　　“虽然是抄本，但也是几十年前的了。”朱梓把那本书放在桌上，韩凌枫却已经陷入忧伤之中。

　　韩凌枫或许是个自卑的人。

　　韩凌枫有很多梦想，他喜欢每一件看起来很棒的事情。

　　韩凌枫小学的时候喜欢某个内地明星，喜欢他美好的造型，羡慕他完美的帅气。韩凌枫听他的歌，自己跟着唱，把歌词歪歪扭扭地抄写在小纸条上，在音乐课上唱。

　　喉咙里发出的声音却像只跌跌撞撞的小鸭子，如此难听。

　　可是全班的同学都在看着自己啊，高傲又潇洒的男生们，漂亮可爱的女生们……

　　然后韩凌枫就逃跑似的窜下了讲台。

　　自己是个又黑又邋遢，什么事情都做不好的小男孩啊。

　　小时候同班的同学会钢琴、会吉他、会画画、会书法，、成绩超级好、去外地城市读书……自己却什么都没有，自己的一切都是弱小与怯懦。

　　后来去学了一点美术，韩凌枫觉得自己是个累赘，换了几个老师，却总是那种失望的眼神，好像是在打发自己，而自己总是只能画出一些烂东西，无丝毫美感。

　　学了一点音乐，却无论如何也做不好。

　　所以就慢慢地放弃了。

　　韩凌枫觉得，自己是不行的，只是享受着吹吹风，听听歌，就很好了。

　　只是苟且地来这世上活着罢了。

　　人间是泥潭，时间是烈焰，熏烤着魂。

　　韩凌枫觉得眼前一片黑，浑身沾满了灰尘，头晕、头疼，手边是一些杂物和散落的几块碎板子。

　　全身都在痛，脖子动不了。身体好像被一些杂物压住了，铁架床、塑料板……还好不是那些有着棱角的箱子。

　　韩凌枫努力地睁开了眼睛，一束阳光照射下来，照亮了眼前的碎屑和树叶。

　　一缕光尘在空中弥漫、飞扬。

　　韩凌枫一会儿醒来，一会儿又昏睡过去。

　　不知过了多久，隐约听到有人在叫喊，那声音有时小得像隔了墙，一会又大得刺耳。

　　过了一会儿，韩凌枫感到有声音传来了，头顶的灰尘和树叶落了下来，阳光烧得更旺了，烧得眼睛很疼。

　　半个小时后，维克多、邓秋离和橘子男把韩凌枫从车厢里拉了出来，韩凌枫的身上受了很多伤，几乎无法直视，但还好没有重物直接砸到他。

　　颈椎似乎受了挫伤，一动就痛得好像断掉一样，整个躯体像是要散架了，不知道胸膛里发生了什么事情，一动或是一说话就很疼，像是有骨头卡着。

　　韩凌枫的意识平静下来后，随即就被周围的景象给震住了。他们身在一片高大的树林里，那是一种以前从未见过的树，有着宽大的叶片，还有密密的气根。那辆大车就倒在一棵树下面，车身的铝皮都弯曲了很多。满地都是折断的枝叶，覆盖着同样茂密的杂草，看上去寸步难行。

　　像是他们摔下了山崖。

　　可当韩凌枫抬头一看，哪里有什么高速公路，四周俨然是一片原始森林，而这时他才明显地感到呼吸的空气，确实与之前也不同了。

　　自己躺在一块泥地上，这是他们刚刚清理出来的。

　　维克多半蹲在一旁，很娴熟地摆弄着酒精、棉布，看上去衣衫不整，有点狼狈，不过依然很细致。

　　身边似乎躺了个人，那是老涛，他还活着，只是整个上身被绷带和夹板包得很奇异，看上去伤得不轻。

　　“这是哪里？”韩凌枫觉得胸口有什么堵着，小心翼翼地挤着字。

　　“不知道。”维克多正从袋子里拿出棉签，准备给韩凌枫消毒。

　　韩凌枫觉得快崩溃了，很害怕，很担忧，好像什么东西在揪着。

　　真的是想死的心都有了。

　　躺在地上，那天空是蓝色的，有些奇异。

　　消完了毒，韩凌枫全身都在颤抖。而这次他隐隐也感觉到了什么不同。那种痛苦虽然强烈，却带着一种让人清爽的力量，就像是经历了脱胎换骨，迎来了新生。

　　当韩凌枫的意识清晰了一些之后，维克多收拾起一个帆布制的挎包，什么也不说，他又看了看老涛的状况，这才起身走到那辆侧翻的车旁。

　　橘子男正斜坐在车旁，从后车厢掏出了一些箱子，和其他完好的东西。维克多过去接过了这件事，并且费力地先掏出了几个看上去很结实的箱子，给了橘子男。

　　“不知道怎么回事，手机没有信号，看上去不妙，我们还是先保证安全吧。”维克多说，“然后，我们再想怎么回去，希望这鬼事儿不会影响到我们正常的生活。”

　　橘子男听到这话神经质地笑了笑，说：“我没意见的哦，只要我们几个不分开就没什么问题！”

　　“额…怎么说呢…你知道食人族的笑话没有？就是那种去自助旅游被抓住的，我看到过三四个了，有被打鞭子的有吞水果的还有上帝坑人的。”

　　“…”

　　“现在城市附近的野外应该已经没有大型野兽了，但是这世上荒唐的事情这么多，我们也不是没遇到过，谁也不知道会发生什么。总之我们可别遇到熊什么的就集体玩儿完了。”

　　“不过重要的东西大多没摔坏。有熊敢来我们就电翻！”橘子男看上去一点也不担心，反而又神经质地激动了，大声喊着。

　　不过他确实能做到，几十分钟后韩凌枫能半躺着了，就看到橘子男弄出了一些电路板和线路，有摄像头，还有一些黑塑料盒子一样的元件，韩凌枫不知道那是什么。

　　橘子男用那台似乎一点没事的笔记本弄着什么，似乎是在调试着那些东西。

　　“还是那个频段，维克多你的手机可以直接接收到信号！”橘子男吼着，维克多远远地应着知道了。

　　“韩凌枫你好像条死鱼…”在周围转了一圈回来的邓秋离调戏着韩凌枫。

　　“……”

　　“你真的好无趣噢！”

　　半个小时后，橘子男已经弄好了数个摄像头，红外感应器，他和邓秋离讨论了最佳的安放地点，完成了这个简直超出了韩凌枫想象的东西。而一旁那台笔记本电脑似乎自动监控着周围的反应。

　　维克多四处找信号，不过还是没头绪。心里想着为什么事情又砸了。

　　此前老涛醒过来了，和韩凌枫聊了会天。和中年人聊天总是你问我答莫名其妙的对方就不高兴了，不过这时候韩凌枫也根本不在意了。

　　老涛是受伤最重的，他整个撞在了方向盘上，七荤八醋的。

　　随后中午了，维克多拿出了一种和果冻一模一样的糖给大家，只不过味道酸酸的。

　　此前一切顺利，但没人觉得心放松下来了。

　　“刚刚邓秋离在周围转了一圈，但发现周围一百多米竟然一点都没有高速公路的影子。而且根据示波器卫星信号，3g信号什么的，什么都没有，反而充斥着一种一种杂乱而莫名其妙的微弱波动。”

　　“我真的不知道我们在什么地方，看这树，就像是YN而最大的问题是，我们的食物不多了，那些是紧急情况用的，我从没想过长期在丛林里生活。

　　韩凌枫觉得仿佛被一只巨大的手抓住似的，自己的学习一直都一般，偶尔也会想到被赶出校门的那一天，不过没想到它来得这样快，这样突然。

　　韩凌枫说了一声就走到周围转了转，一直到看不到他们，听不到他们的声音为止了。突然心里就有一种冲动，干脆一走了之吧，就这样远离所有会说话的东西，一直走，饿了随便塞点什么树叶，吃也好，饿着也好，能吃也好，生病了也好，活着也好，死了也没什么。

　　可就在这时，突然有声音传来。

　　一个女孩站在不远处，穿着豹皮的裹胸，手里拿着一把石矛，眼睛里满是好奇。

　　那一刻，穿过密叶的无数阳光，在她身旁盛开了。

/fst/sky/moon-river/One. The Eage/17.The End.txt



　　一

　　轰鸣声预示着大难临头，撕裂一切的狂风席卷了整个世界！

　　韩凌枫被埋到土里，泥土在他的呼吸道内燃烧，卷起的湖泊将他包裹，他感到自己快死了，他头脑一片空白，躯体反而不受控制地疯狂挣扎着，散发着巨大的的活力。

　　雷声震耳欲聋，闪电夹杂在天地间。

　　躯体在被撞击，刮伤，韩凌枫慌了，难以想象这场灾难过后会怎样。

　　心脏不遗余力地跳动着，像是要从胸膛而出。

　　不知过了多久，头脑清醒了些，他这才发现风暴早就停止了，只是自己一直在眩晕。

　　他直接吐了出来，然后被呛到，他挣扎了几下，竟然挣脱了。

　　他正倒插在泥土里，全身都是淤泥、碎土。

　　全身酥软，脖子一动就疼，他跪在地上，用手把沾满淤泥的头抬了起来。

　　四周一片狼藉，简直是天灾的景象，所见尽是黄土、碎石，掩埋着倒塌的树木，一片绝望。

　　几分钟过去了，韩凌枫清醒一些了，看向四周，寻找事件的中心。

　　就在这时，大地剧烈震动，巨大的撞击声传来，韩凌枫摔倒在地。

　　他只看到在远方的天边，破碎的巨石诡异地悬浮着。

　　它们旋转，相互挤压，轰隆声仿佛暴雷。

　　天空变了色，整个世界笼罩在极端非自然的紫白色光芒里，仿佛末日来临。

　　韩凌枫歪歪倒倒地努力站起来，擦干净眼睛环顾四周。周围一片狼藉，他又看向那异变的中心，那团奇异旋转石头似乎稳定下来了，不再发出尖啸声。

　　韩凌枫呆住了，现在怎么办？

　　一双手拉住韩凌枫，那是浑身狼藉的维克多，他一条腿瘸了。

　　他仿佛要说什么，可就在这时，巨大的闪电一片惨白，爆炸声几乎要将人耳震聋。

　　仿佛一颗迫击炮在韩凌枫身后爆炸，世界一片白昼，仿佛神话中的永恒。

　　二

　　仿佛什么东西爆炸了，冲击波将阿龙震飞，撞倒在一片废墟上边，半截木桩与他擦身而过，五脏六腑一阵剧痛。

　　他慢慢站起身来，观察周围。

　　这是一间被震倒的屋子，木桩断裂，到处都是。

　　这是酋长大营的废墟。

　　纵火犯被压在一根巨大的木头下面，他呻吟着。

　　阿龙跑过去，奋力将纵火犯拉了出来。

　　阿龙虽然看上去比较清醒，可性情极端，他想要建军的承诺，他会做到底；而纵火犯是个很奇怪的人，有时对财富不屑一顾，有时却为了一点小事捅出天大的篓子。

　　他们之间的感情还是可以的。

　　“建军呢？”阿龙问。

　　“他当时离那颗手雷太近了，估计凶多吉少。”

　　阿龙一摇一晃地过去翻开废墟，最终他看到了建军的身体。

　　那句身体极其可怖，多处要害被弹片击中，内脏被震碎，多处骨折，看上去已经是不活了。

　　阿龙正灰心，忽然建军的鼻孔里钻出了一团灰色的物质，它似乎是某种活体。

　　阿龙不知道怎么办才好，这时他的手机忽然响了，很大声。

　　阿龙疑惑地拿出电话，他一般都是把电话调成静音或者振动的。

　　上边显示着未知号码，然后电话自动接听了，且调整到扬声器模式。

　　“我没事，把我带走……”电话里传来建军的声音。

　　阿龙呆住了，这时，建军尸体的鼻孔忽然钻出了白色的东西，奇异地蠕动着。

　　阿龙感到一阵恶寒，仿佛夜都变凉了。

　　“记得你的承诺……”阿龙颤抖地说。

　　此时，另一边。

　　“我们走！”维克多说。

　　韩凌枫跟着维克多，可总觉得少了什么。

　　“朱梓他们呢？”

　　“不知道，我们管不了那么多了。”维克多说。

　　朱梓怎么办呢？他们自己又怎么办呢？

　　剧烈的地震从身后传来，每几分钟就会响一声，仿佛摩天大楼在身后追赶他们。

　　“那是什么？”韩凌枫颤抖地问道。

　　“不知道。”维克多回答地很干脆。

　　不知多久过去了，两人遇到了橘子男，他看上去裤子都要吓尿了，怪叫不停。

　　韩凌枫正担心着，忽然“啪”的一声，他后颈一疼，晕了过去。

　　“你这是？”维克多问站在韩凌枫身后的霸哥。

　　霸哥一边看着那地震的来源，一边背起韩凌枫：“别看我，老大说让我弄昏他。”

　　几人来到了一片空地，身后的地震频率越来越快，仿佛摩天大楼奔跑起来了。

　　一名留着刘海的少年站在那里看着手机，他身后站着两名少女，一人短发，一人长发披肩。

　　地上是一堆白色宇航服。

　　“尼玛的，你不会是想要……”橘子男嚷嚷着。

　　“嗯，我给韩凌枫带了一件。”少年头也不抬。

　　终

　　高中毕业了，韩凌枫穿着一身黑色短袖，牛仔裤，看上去也是个成长了的少年了。

　　他万万没想到，毕业典礼上，讲话的竟然是回家乡考试的邓秋离。

　　她也留级了。

　　她竟然没有戴眼镜，没有扎马尾，穿着一身苏格兰格子衬衣，长发披肩。

　　她讲话。

　　“同学们，在人生的路上我们会遇到许多困难。

　　“其中有一些，会在一开始就令你措手不及。

　　“但不要放弃。

　　“学习是人的本能，人们无时不刻不在学习。

　　“也许头几次你会感到失望，头十几遍你会感到失意。你甚至不能告诉别人。

　　“但当你几十次遇到它呢？你可能会有些绝望。上百次呢？

　　“只要你还活着，你便是在克服困难。

　　“别放弃啊，只要你始终活着，你便能克服所有困难！

　　“…………”

　　讲毕，台下掌声响起。

　　韩凌枫听到这里，忽然很感动，十三年了。

　　可又一阵忧伤。

　　朱梓说过，人总是经历痛苦，才能变得顽强。

　　痛苦是生命的宿命。

　　一辈子要经历数不清的痛苦……

　　可他又想起邓秋离飘逸的长发，自己在梦中，吻过她呢。

　　秋风很清凉，芦苇远看像麦浪。

　　醒来的时候，这世界都是疲倦的。

　　韩凌枫是个非常爱睡懒觉的人，常常一觉醒来就已经是大中午了，韩凌枫的妈妈说他什么也做不成。

　　不过韩凌枫倒是经常想，绞尽脑汁给雇主打工，拿微薄的薪水，如果一生就是这样，那么也无所谓了，倒不如浑浑噩噩地活着，似乎差不多。

　　自己本就是个平凡的人，如果非得说自己有什么独特之处的话，那就是怂，至少韩凌枫几乎没看到过比自己还怂的人。

　　无所谓。

　　不过今天很特殊，他身在一个陌生的环境，充满着好奇与警觉，在这种情况下，就一点也不困了。

　　可是韩凌枫感到自己昏昏沉沉的，好像被蒙上了一顶头盔。

　　随即另一种感觉又相继而来了。

　　果然又头疼了，还比较严重，真的是看来今天不好过。

　　韩凌枫经常会头疼，天一凉就容易头疼，不过他也不太在意。

　　看着玻璃窗外透进来的日光，似乎已经是中午了，只是光线比较暗，光线比较白。

　　韩凌枫刚一拉开被子，一股凉气就窜近了被子，冷得他感冒直竖。

　　这是……冬天么？现在不是五月份？

　　不过韩凌枫也没太在意，自己又不是什么大人物，不知道的事情还多，也又是某种气候现象吧。

　　小心翼翼地把胳膊探出去，韩凌枫把外衣拉住穿上，又赶紧把裤子也穿上。

　　韩凌枫头疼得把脑袋都歪了过去，好像是右边脑袋被人揪住了摔来摔去。

　　韩凌枫小时候肚子也疼，半夜的时候疼到蜷缩成一团，但是从没告诉过别人。

　　不过也许是因为这是小时候养成的习惯，韩凌枫对于这种头疼有着异乎常人的抵抗能力，而且无视痛苦，就像一只被绳子拴着的老母鸡，从小到大总是被绳子绕住了抬着一只腿跳……

　　其实早就习以为常了。

　　不过想到这里韩凌枫又觉得自己很傻，这种被绳子绕住一辈子的自豪感是哪里来的？！

　　穿好了衣服，韩凌枫把手机和借的充电器取了下来，放好。

　　韩凌枫像是变了一个人似的，安静地整理好被子，棉的质地有些硬，像是那种批发的，但是很干净。

　　昨天夜里韩凌枫很晚才睡着，反复地回想之前的遭遇，觉得事情很诡异。

　　母亲生气的样子很歇斯底里，父亲很极端，虽然不是很明显的奇怪，不过这是韩凌枫第一次见到这种样子的父母。

　　韩凌枫很不安，觉得父母应该是发生了什么事情，在这种情况下，自己真的能把他们就在家里么？

　　虽然还未打定主意，不过韩凌枫觉得自己有些想回家了，况且明天就要回学校了，韩凌枫今天肯定是要做一个决定的，是回趟家还是直接去学校。

　　还是直接回学校吧，书本、饭钱什么的，这周先借着，下周再做打算，回趟家把银行卡拿出来，这样的话打工什么的也能坚持一段时间。

　　只是心里稍微有些不安。

　　理了理自己的鸡窝头，似乎不那么乱了，可是肚子有些空，昨天吃了面包和几口啤酒，现在上的零钱都已经花得七七八八的。

　　但是自己是不能厚着脸皮找才认识的维克多借钱的。

　　韩凌枫是不情愿因为自己的缘故给别人造成麻烦的，昨天听说维克多要睡在驾驶座，韩凌枫想都没想就直接拒绝了，怎么能因为自己的缘故委屈车主呢？

　　不过维克多表示自己平常也睡驾驶室，而且他还懂得怎么保护自己的颈椎，这样，韩凌枫才觉得自己没有理由再拒绝了。

　　这当然是理所当然的事情，不用思考，也不需要去解释什么。

　　车的角落里摆着一些箱子，看上去很整齐，不过它们出现在这里是很正常的事情，韩凌枫随意瞟了一眼，打开门，走到了外边。

　　我晕，这是哪里？

　　韩凌枫只看到车窗外是一片荒凉，只有稀稀落落的几棵树，杂草丛生。

　　这是在高速公路？韩凌枫觉得自己眼镜快掉下来了。

　　自己不会真的被拐买了吧？原来人贩子这么面善？

　　下了车，韩凌枫发现自己是在高速公路的一个未建成的休息点，这里空空荡荡的，本该有休息处楼房的地方空无一物。

　　韩凌枫还处于呆滞状态，本能地找去维克多，绕着车走了一圈，发现不远处维克多正和另外三个人围着一口锅，正在边煮着东西边吹牛。

　　那三人两男一女，男的一个大概二十岁左右，白白胖胖的，戴着眼镜，动作一板一眼的；另一人看上去年龄稍大，皮肤很黑，很面善。

　　女孩子扎着干净利落的细马尾辫，戴着眼镜，皮肤很白很可爱。

　　随即维克多就看到了韩凌枫，笑着走了过来。

　　“你醒啦。快来吃东西。”

　　韩凌枫呆滞了，这到底是哪儿啊，自己是被拐卖了么？但是总觉得不像……

　　随即几人都看着他，其中那个女孩子的眼神有些怪，看上去很淡很熟悉，却又不太认识。

　　“邓秋离？”

　　这个女生是韩凌枫的小学同学，学习一直很好，初中毕业后她就去了省会城市读书，学习好人缘好，一直让韩凌枫心里很是羡慕。

　　六年的同学使得这个人已经深深地存在于韩凌枫的心中。

　　那时的她是一只活泼的小老虎，而现在多了沉默和空灵。

　　“来我给你拿碗筷。”年龄大一些的男子很随和，很热情地站起来，出现在一旁的简易桌附近。

　　简易桌……这帮人是倒斗的么？

　　“哎呦，变帅咯！”邓秋离打趣地说，这让韩凌枫不知所措。

　　“知道你有很多疑问，不过还是吃过了再告诉你。”邓秋离一只手斜托着下巴，说。

　　这种情况韩凌枫从没遇到过，但是身在高速公路上这一事实对他的冲击实在太大，试问有谁遇到过这样的事？

　　韩凌枫心里有小小的奇怪，于是微微举起手中的碗，指着一块煮鸡肉说:“该不会有蒙汗药什么的吧？”

　　邓秋离则满脸黑线地看着他:“你当我们是来旅游的，我们是来打工的！当然有自己的事了！”

　　邓秋离还是很可爱，韩凌枫虽然觉得有些不习惯，却还是很高兴的。

　　但是心里似乎有什么东西堵住了似的，这一顿饭吃的很难受。

　　那个中年人叫老潘，特长是做饭，眼镜男很单纯，大家都叫他橘男。

　　然后只剩下韩凌枫最后吃完，桌边也只有维克多在那里，其他人则是收拾东西去了。

　　韩凌枫说：“那你们还要去哪里？我今天要回学校。”

　　“韩凌枫，听我说，你今天恐怕回不了学校了。”维克多看着韩凌枫的眼睛。

　　“为什么？”韩凌枫感到莫名其妙。

　　“其实如果我们早一点认识，那么你可以看到建军在这里。”维克多拿起自己的手机，点开了一个视频，“我们是一个团队。”

　　“OFU工作室。”

　　韩凌枫看着那手机屏幕，是一个人拿着手机悄悄地走进一个昏暗房间，然后房间里坐着一个矮瘦黑的成熟男孩，那是建军。他面前开着一面显示器，上面有一些奇怪的波段。

　　“什么情况？”

　　“韩凌枫，我要告诉你一件事，”维克多幽幽地盯着韩凌枫，“那是脑电波的图段，有关人的感情。”

　　“建军在做用电磁波袭击人类大脑，从而控制人们情绪的实验。”

　　怎么可能？韩凌枫呆住了。

　　“我们一直都低估建军了，这小子真不知道是怎么回事。”

　　“而且我们可以肯定，建军袭击的你的父母，使用无线电阵列。”

　　“总之，你不能随便回家，不过没关系，你应该不会有事。而且，你只有这一个选择。”

　　“为了表达歉意，我把它送给你，它的名字叫‘恶意’。反重力的哦。”

　　维克多突然就起身走了，只丢下一个黑色的手环样的东西，竟然飘浮在地面上。

 　　“你就这样活着吧！”黑暗中有人竭力嘶吼。

　　像是本呆在鞘里的剑被人猛地抽出，刺眼的白光充斥着每一寸角落，灼烧着他的眼睛。

　　男孩的眼睛猛地闭上了，他虚弱地惨叫了一声，用双手把眼睛蒙了起来。

　　“别乱动，你的脑袋还有些晕吧。”光线暗了一下，韩凌枫的眼睛眯开了一条缝，一丝笑容浮现面前这张年轻男人的脸上。

　　韩凌枫真的安静下来了，手也不再抖，开始屏住呼吸。几分钟后，他克服了恐惧，耳、鼻、触觉、还有闭上的眼睛开始以他此生从未有过的高效率进行着工作——精神已经紧绷到了最大程度。在陌生的环境下，肾上腺素被以超快的速度分泌，流遍全身，所有感官都在尽最大可能地收集着周围的信息。

　　自己正穿着一件粗糙的衣服，这是廉价批量生产的，就像医院里的那种一次性病号服。

　　真是奇怪，那个男人的声音里明明是一种淡然、僵硬的陌生，却又是那么的有道理，好像他说的话就是对的，是为了你好。

　　“呼”。

　　眼看躺在手术室里的少年已然安静了下来，维克多才安静地呼了口气，双手铁爪松了下来。

　　“你昏迷了，我们要对你进行一些检查。”平静的语气好像是水。

　　“检查？……你不是医生！”韩凌枫的反应很快，面前是一个很干净的年轻男人，整齐的头发，黑色的休闲西装。

　　维克多此时有些犯难了，不好解释不好解释不好解释……

　　“我们是……私人医护组织。”维克多说，语气很平淡，他本来就是私人医护人员，或者医学爱好者什么的，也就是说，如果韩凌枫的身体出了问题他可能还得承担法律责任。

　　韩凌枫这才安静下来，但是此刻他的脑袋里只觉茫然一片。

　　私人医护组织，那是什么？自己为什么会晕倒？自己……现在在哪里？

　　总是觉得奇奇怪怪的，不过维克多的检查都是很专业的样子，而且还让让他听得明明白白，维克多的能力，倒是令韩凌枫不自觉地相信了他的话。

　　韩凌枫能动自己的手了，他发现身上没有任何管子电极什么的之后松了一口气，揉着自己的太阳穴，从手术台上坐了起来。

　　眼前的男人很眼熟，就像是电视剧中经常出现的那种男人。

　　优质、干净、穿衣服有品位的人竟然真的出现了！

　　韩凌枫看了看四周，他现在正在一个狭小而且很暗的空间里，手术台旁的柜子上放着一盏台灯是唯一的光源。

　　两旁都堆着一些箱子，角落里还有一些金属器具反射着一块块的光点。看上去这个房间在正常情况下是用来放置杂物和器具的。

　　“这里是哪里？”韩凌枫提高了警惕。

　　“这里是救助车，你的大脑受到强电磁波的影响，暂停了工作，不过很快就恢复了。”

　　电磁波？

　　救助车？

　　“你是誰？为什么我没有在医院里？你们没有把我送进医院里么？”

　　其实韩凌枫想问一句，自己的衣服是不是他们帮自己换的，因为他现在正穿着一件白色的粗布衣服。

　　但是这个念头一冒出来就被他自己否定了。这个问题不是废话么？这样感觉自己就像“被救的小姑娘”什么的……

　　这是什么鬼主意……韩凌枫“唰”的就把这个念头抛在脑后了。

　　“我叫维克多，他们也都叫我维克多。”

　　维克多拿出了口袋里的一则证件，上面的“姓名”一栏里写着“维克多”。

　　“维先生？你不是姓维吧！”那眼睛真是瞪得有汤圆那么大。

　　“是的。”

　　“哼哈哈哈哈哈哈！”韩凌枫觉得胸口有股气不受控制地被挤了出来，顿时笑得像猪似的。

　　“我能出去看看么？”韩凌枫觉得不知道怎么回事，他觉得面前的这个人有些奇怪，小声地问道。

　　“恩？”维克多眼角闪过一丝厉色，挺拔地立在黑暗中，活像一个魔神。

　　吓一跳。

　　未知地点，车祸第二天。

　　一阵冷冷的风吹来，冻醒了蜷缩着的韩凌枫，他使劲裹着一床单薄的硬被子，全身散发着稻草的味道。

　　寒气逼人，过了好一会儿，他挣扎着从床上爬了起来。

　　这是一个介于古代宅院与部落山寨的房间，周围的一些木制家具摆得很紧凑，到处都是书，韩凌枫借着床前窗外的银白月光，寻找能御寒的东西。

　　最后他在一个精致的木衣柜里找到了很多被子，把自己裹得严严实实的，才开始暖和起来。

　　停止颤抖后，韩凌枫开始回忆起之前的事情。

　　路很远，昨天夜里他睡着了。

　　这个略窄的房子有些乱，不过里面的东西都很精致，看上去不太像韩凌枫所见过的村子，完全不像。

　　然后韩凌枫开始发呆，他最擅长发呆了。

　　很长时间过去了，有光穿过窗纱，那是诡异的血红色，投影到房间里，成了一块红斑。

　　像是地狱的风景。

　　这一幕把韩凌枫吓坏了，他听见自己的心跳像是敲鼓声，几乎挣破胸膛跳了出来。

　　当他感觉自己又能动了，就撩开了那手织的芦苇窗纱。

　　看着窗外的景象，他呆住了。

　　那是一片血红色的天空，万里无云。远方地平线上露出半个圆，穿过万里长空的金色光芒像一个巨大的瞳孔。窗外是斜坡，坡下错落着一大片木屋，全用茅草盖着顶，再远方有茂密的森林，在红光下成了墨一般的颜色。

　　这是一个极其美丽的村子，很多屋子旁摆放着各种器具。村中有河流过，临近的房屋装有水车，远处被河流分成两边，一边是树林，一边是农田。

　　韩凌枫难以置信地望着窗外的景色，好像那窗子里只是装着一个瑰丽的红宝石。

　　良久，他一点都不困了，打开一扇木门走了出去。

　　这小屋落在一片不高的山坡上，草地上参差地长着野花、蒲公英、土拨鼠的洞，还有一条窄石板路，而一条河就从韩凌枫不远处流过去。

　　它们在血红色的清晨里显得很魔幻。

　　空气好像水洗过的，充满了活力，风会流过你的身体，牵你的头发，因为风是另一片海。

　　韩凌枫的腰还有些疼，他情不自禁地坐到那山坡顶，看着这个村子。

　　这真的是个村子，完全不加规矩，看不到一点深色的工业时代的产物，韩凌枫有种错觉，他是不是走进了一部电影？

　　那金色的瞳孔好像又睁大了，天空中的红色在渐渐消褪。这时有笛声传来，韩凌枫看到那个少女坐在不远处的草垛上，一旁还有一只白色的小狗。

　　朱梓拿着一支竹制的笛子，在清晨吹长笛，狗四处嗅着，时不时望向遥远的地方。

　　音乐声在风里流淌着，就好像她其实是在风里吹笛，那个身影只不过是个背景。

　　韩凌枫琢磨着自己是不是该走近，最终还是停在原地。

　　过了一会儿维克多从山坡下走来了，他眼眶发黑，看上去很虚弱，昨晚怕是一夜没睡。

　　“很抱歉啊，你旷课了，这下不好说了，我们现在在哪里都是个问题。”维克多说。

　　“噢。”

　　韩凌枫啥也不想干，他本就不想回去，他无所谓的，可维克多正看着他，于是他只好又开始摆弄维克多的手环。“恶意”啥的叫出名字来太傻，于是韩凌枫直接称它为“手环”，这样好多了。

　　手环在手臂上滑来滑去，虽然有重量，却感觉不到摩擦，就好像很神奇，好像这是一种并不存在的东西。

　　维克多本来有很多话想说，想说他对红色清晨的一些猜测，他还想起了那个女神一般无暇的女孩青洒，想起了曾经迷茫的自己，他想说不够好是因为没人爱。

　　可却说不出口，于是维克多也放弃了，和韩凌枫安安静静地吹风，听朱梓吹笛子。

　　夜幕漆黑，星空稀稀落落的，隐约可见树影。

　　韩凌枫觉得自己本来就不聪明，这样一弄说不准还会影响以后的智力发育。

　　诶，真是什么奇怪的事都有，倒霉真是没下线的……

　　“你没事吧?”一旁的维克多关心地问道，“是不是有点冷？”

　　“没有！”韩凌枫反应过来，几乎想举起双手作投降状，心说你都那么牛了还不给人点空间啊！

　　韩凌枫和维克多两人正站在市运动场旁，之前韩凌枫昏迷了五个多小时。

　　那辆干净的白车停在路旁，车牌上写着“XHNN361”，韩凌枫不经联想起一群黑的黄的白的猛男穿着各大名厂赞助的战袍在高档的运动场内打球，场边有欢呼的球迷、皱着眉头的球迷、安静紧张的教练、一脸没表情的新闻工作者……一时间浮想联翩。

　　但是很难想象这辆车里是一个储物室兼小型急救室，之前自己就是在那里被救了，韩凌枫不知道维克多为什么会救自己，真是一头雾水。

　　现在人家还要把自己送回去，还让韩凌枫回去后最好去医院脑科做个核磁共振……

　　“你知道圣诞节是什么时候么？”维克多忽地问到，像他这样板着一张脸的帅哥穿厚了就像快冻住一样，表情更加凝滞了。

　　“额，十二月份吧……”韩凌枫倒是被问住了，据说这世上节日挺多，像情人节都是每个月都有，还是不同颜色的，还有不同的象征意义。只可惜韩凌枫这样的男子无福消受。

　　到不是说韩凌枫不该得到平等的待遇，只是似乎这世上有些人便是这样，永远都是最平凡的那一个。

　　那是人家的节日，不是自己的。韩凌枫从小学起就天天有听到那些可爱的女生在聊各种节日，什么光棍节、白色情人节愚人节各种节不管是社会承认的还是网友自命的，都与自己无关罢了，鬼知道为什么那些漂亮的女生就能享受它们，天知道！

　　在韩凌枫的记忆里，邓秋离便是这其中最活跃的一个。

　　那个自小便被公认的小美女，似乎没有人真正夸过她漂亮，似乎也没有女生因为她的美貌而嫉妒她，大家只是根深蒂固地承认了这个事实。就好像每个人只有把自己最好的一面展示给她，把祝福都给她，宁愿默默地欣赏她的美也不愿去触碰，好像她就是女神，她该漂亮该好。

　　在韩凌枫的记忆里，唯一有人对邓秋离做过的最过分的事情，也就是那个又帅又开朗的男生趁她不在时偷穿她的衣服，还笑着给人家看。

　　当时很美很可爱的邓秋离笑了，露出两颗小虎牙，皮肤白皙得好像玉石一般，三下两下就把自己的衣服从那个娘娘腔身上扒了下来，不再理他。

　　但是自始至终，邓秋离都是笑着的，给人的印象便是真善美！仔细一想还是真善美！

　　还记得顾小蔓在狂热状态时，总是拉着韩凌枫做一些他以前不知道的游戏，比如真心话大冒险啦，写小说啦什么的。

　　顾小蔓和女闺蜜在某街吃串串烧，紧急召唤韩凌枫，韩凌枫在半小时内就屁颠屁颠地出现了，整个行动没有任何亮点，成功贯彻了“万事低调”的原则！

　　整个游戏过程依然保持低调和一种原始的神秘感！韩凌枫觉得自己像是一条狗，在女主人及其好友或者是及其同伙的指使下开心地完成了一系列不礼貌的“犯罪活动”，然后悠然逃离现场。

　　但是在独自回家的路上，韩凌枫觉得自己始终是个局外人，但是没有什么不对头。

　　顾小蔓在这种场合举止大方自然，就好像是生长在其中的一棵树，享受着适宜的生存环境和新鲜的空气。那是别人的大冒险，是顾小蔓的。

　　那时天很黑，风吹着很冷，韩凌枫穿得很厚。

　　“怎么突然问这个？”韩凌枫注意到维克多还在看着自己，马上回过神来。和别人交谈时走神是不礼貌的。

　　维克多淡淡地笑了：“可能看到戴圣诞帽的兔子哦。”

　　“额，什么……”韩凌枫真心没想过这个问题，想着这人帅爆了。

　　维克多没有再说话，韩凌枫的脑子里却是像炸开了锅，自己会说话吗？这样别人怎么说话啊！

　　韩凌枫难得这么认真地说话，他觉得自己应该做些个什么动作丰富下肢体语言，比如搓手什么的，不过总感觉这样就有些虚假的样子了，于是干脆站着没动，倒像个灯光下的小木偶。

　　“你不知道，这是异常天气。之前我的手机收到气象预警了，是冷空气袭击江城，之后两大个多小时气温就开始下降。”维克多的表情更少了，整个人像是座冰雕，“反常天气。”

　　这下韩凌枫是真的无话可说了，不知道怎么办，他觉得自己该说一句“我的手机没电了啊”，但是想来想去觉得太牢骚而且不礼貌，于是便只得盯着维克多看。

　　几分钟过去了，维克多转身走向那辆加大型的白色救助车，说：“走吧，我送你回去。”

　　深夜里的江城是安静而空旷的，在橘黄色的光线尽头，树影像犬牙一般交错，像是韩凌枫本子上缭乱的笔画。

　　“恩恩我家就在那前边……多谢了！”韩凌枫从副驾驶座上站了起来，尽量让自己表现出感激和高兴的感情，其实他自己心里确实是感激、高兴，但是脸上却是没有表情。

　　也许感激之类这些东西放在心里就好吧？这样反而有些做作，不过韩凌枫觉得不作任何表示也不太好，于是就尽量让自己动作语气自然些。

　　“你白天的时候最好去医院脑科做个检查。”

　　临走时，维克多深深地看了韩凌枫一眼。

　　“谢谢啦！”韩凌枫说着，裹紧了那件维克多赠送的粗制病号服，下了车，回头招了招手。

　　白色大车闪了闪车灯，安静地开走了，转过路口，只有黄白色光柱穿行在黑夜里。

　　韩凌枫独自走在家门口，那条不知走过千百遍的小径上，那盏年龄比他还要大的路灯，把光打在他的背上，韩凌枫第一次欣赏这里的夜景。

　　还好吧，四周安静极了，是那种童话里的小妖精会出现的场景啊！夜幕下的小排楼像是带着中山帽的老头，韩凌枫的心情从未有过的舒畅。

　　漫步走过门口的小花园，比夜幕更发黑暗的树枝在地面生长。

　　韩凌枫想起小的时候若是回家晚了，夜幕下的小树林在韩凌枫眼里便是可怕的，像是有什么怪物藏在树叶间沙沙作响，或是在你身后尾随着你。

　　所以小时候的韩凌枫每次都是心惊肉跳地用自己最快的速度跑过这里。

　　走上楼道，楼梯的扶手上全是灰尘，在月光下潜伏着。

　　少年时代的韩凌枫总是背着大书包走路回家，而这节楼梯便是他长途跋涉的最后一段路程，极其的锻炼身体，但是走过这段路程，也终于回到了家。

　　韩凌枫来到家门口，门掩着没关，韩凌枫轻手轻脚地溜进去，摸到自己的房间，便直挺挺地倒在床上，心累啊！

　　这一天，太扯了。

/fst/sky/moon-river/One. The Eage/5.Night.txt



　时值二零一三年年五月二日晚。

　　夜晚街道上很多车，人很少，行道树很多，在夜色里张牙舞爪的。

　　黑暗里点缀了无数光影，那是炽白色街灯和一些不关门的店家，比方说韩凌枫之前呆的那家网吧。

　　韩凌枫不知道自己该不该说话，与父母吵架离家出走，却是被刚刚认识的神秘哥子“抓”到，这怎么说也像是神转折啊，而且这几天发生的事都像是神转折。

　　虽说这世上那么多未知的事情，可是对一个普通人来说，哪有一天之内就遇到这么多稀有的事情？这什么情况？自己莫不是被什么人盯上了吧？

　　话说人类的感知其实还是十分强大的，至少有些时候遇到恶意，即使你没反应过来，但还是会感到有些奇怪。

　　当然，很多时候我们即使感到了奇怪，却还是没能找到怪异感的来源，这也是很多悲剧发生的原因吧。

　　韩凌枫在这方面感到无能为力，他还很小的时候也很调皮，喜欢从背后偷偷蒙住好朋友的眼睛、趁爸爸睡觉时悄悄地走进去看着他什么的，但是别人经常能一下就发现自己，而且制止住了自己，韩凌枫确实没有这个能力，常常遭殃。

　　所以韩凌枫也默认了，自己没有这方面的能力。

　　夜幕下的天空黑的像是一面镜子，你因好奇而在半夜去看的那种镜子，像黑色的大理石，深邃又神秘。

　　而韩凌枫就像这巨大夜空下的一只小蚂蚁、没头苍蝇什么的，燃烧着忧愁的火焰。

　　我应该说些什么吧？应该找些什么来聊吧？维克多这家伙，沉默了……聊啥呢？

　　自己刚刚莫名其妙地被从网吧抓出来，还是被一个只有一面之缘的家伙，他就像从青春偶像剧中跑出来的人物……是的，青春偶像剧里跑出来的，这家伙……

　　韩凌枫想着，一身不自在。

　　想到后来韩凌枫觉得自己就像是把难题都推到维克多身上了一样，像是那种因为自己的条件没有别人强就把错误乱推的……行为一样。

　　于是韩凌枫就不想了，开始学企鹅走路，想着它走起路来一摇一晃的样子。

　　这也是一种信息交流吧，韩凌枫这样想。

　　身旁的维克多穿着针织衫，外套某种白色动物毛制成的背心，围着黑白格子围巾，黑色的头发几乎挡住了他的黑色眼睛，彩色方框眼镜把他的瘦削脸颊衬托得很完美，脸白得像是某种玉雕，表情无可挑剔。

　　维克多带着韩凌枫穿过空荡的马路，拐了个弯，路口边停着一辆白色的大车，比韩凌枫看到过的医院的救护车还要大一点，停在在快掉色的停车线内。

　　维克多走到车边，凌厉地用钥匙打开车门。

　　韩凌枫从白天起就有一种感觉，好像维克多的说话方式、动作习惯和平常的人不太一样，带着某种规范，好像曾经对每一个动作都有练习一般，而这种感觉似乎只有在军人身上才普遍存在。

　　据说西点军校的军人们连吃饭用叉的动作都是规范了的，什么手臂与手肘的角度啦，右手持餐刀切了牛排之后左手持叉的旋转啦，如果不合标准，会受到惩罚。

　　可以想象西点军校出来的军人身上每一个动作都是经过长年累月的训练的，而维克多走路的姿势、拿文件纸的姿势，熟练的开门动作，就给人这种经过打磨的军人气息，恍若一个铁人。

　　韩凌枫不知道自己与这样一位男神能沾什么边。

　　小时候妈妈总是对韩凌枫说，你看别人家的孩子才多大一点，钢琴就十级了，多厉害，直接就可以当钢琴老师了，一堂课一小时收两百……

　　而韩凌枫知道，钢琴跟天赋有关，不说什么乐感、节奏感、“从娃娃抓起”啥的，如果小孩子的手指天生不直，那敲琴键是没有力度的，而这样都还不放弃钢琴，唯一的办法就是把那只手指的指骨敲断重新接上。

　　诸如此类还有很多。

　　厉害的人就是厉害，闪闪发光。

　　其实韩凌枫也学过几个月的吉他，韩凌枫也从来没有怀疑过自己的天赋，韩凌枫知道，天才都是百分之九十九的汗水加上百分之一的灵感才能被称之为天才，那些在某方面著名的人，都是比任何人都要勤奋。

　　韩凌枫从来没有觉得自己比别人差，所以他的妈妈和朋友——一个音乐老师来家里作客时，韩凌枫就被夸“手指肉垫好肥”、“适合弹钢琴”云云，然后询问韩凌枫要不要测试一下节奏感。

　　韩凌枫答应了，他从没练过什么节奏感，只是大概知道是什么样的意思，但是那是专业术语，专业术语啊！听起来就好专业的好不好！

　　此音乐老师出了三道节奏，韩凌枫惊呆了，他没想到节奏这么长，而且一道比一道长，于是全败。

　　于是“节奏”一词从此再没被韩凌枫说出口，这个效果贯穿他的童年。

　　韩凌枫觉得，自己是没有音乐天赋的那种人，但是和之前一样喜欢听歌，乐器什么的，自己能弹给自己听就行了吧。

　　此时，维克多已经上车，然后喊着韩凌枫。

　　“你为什么来找我？……你是怎么找到我的？我跟你不熟！”韩凌枫猛然回过神来，大声地问维克多，此时，雪亮的前车灯被车内蓄电池的电流点亮了，四周一片明亮，一些铝合金卷帘门上反射出银白的光芒。

　　这灯光在漆黑的大楼房，黑色的树包围的街道上，像是一把火炬在流转跳跃。

　　韩凌枫觉得根据自己的性格，半夜跟着一个今天才认识的人在街道上有些不大可能，但是此刻这事情就是发生了，维克多的身上带着某种正义的气息，那种优秀的孩子身上带着的那种气息，那种军人的气息，你一眼就看出来他不是坏人，因为你习惯了，这样的人都是很好很优秀的人，他的行为也无可挑剔。

　　维克多的声音从车里传出来，还是那样的没有感情，但是给人一种平实的亲和力，这是韩凌枫听到过的维克多的最大的声音。

　　“我们就是来找你的。我和你的室友，建军……我们很熟。”

　　韩凌枫怔了一下，他没想到自己沉默寡言的室长居然会和别人交流，真是闻所未闻。

　　变形金刚一样的人会和别人交流吗？一个在一年里话都不说一句天都不聊只是像机械一样重复学校规定的人，会这么隐蔽地和外人有如此感情？还让维克多这样的人在夜里到处跑？不过话说回来维克多到底是怎么找到自己的啊……

　　这么说来这事儿是与建军这个妖人有关了？韩凌枫心里打下了无数的大大的问号。

　　建军是一个什么样的人呢？又瘦又小，面无表情，年龄比韩凌枫小，实在初中同学里最让韩凌枫信服的人，而且是韩凌枫的室长。

　　在班里，建军不太有存在感，但是他是那种你打心底里佩服，不愿去冒犯的那种人，也是韩凌枫的室友，一个不冷不热的人，一个班主任一提到就满脸是放心的人，一个班级里幽灵一样的人……

　　这些加起来，就诠释了形容一类人的词语：“学霸”、“学神”、“男神”、“某神”，每一个用在他的身上都是那么合适。

　　建军是韩凌枫所认识的人中，唯一可能比维克多还要优秀的人，对韩凌枫来说，建军和维克多这两个名字，意味着的是优等生的世界，一个突如其来的，充满未知的，光明的世界。

　　人或者飞蛾，诸如此类，终究是要循着光明而去的。

　　这时维克多也愣住了，车前窗里的那张脸在黑暗中模糊不清。

　　他有些犹豫地说：“额……这里有些事和你有关，只是想和你说清楚，来龙去脉。邓秋离在，还有……顾小曼的事。”，那声音很自然，是在说一件正经事的语气，就像是电视剧里的一句话。

　　韩凌枫小时候和爸爸妈妈一起看电视剧，觉得很喜欢其中的人物说话的方式，但是自己每次去模仿，总是感觉自己很卑微、或是有人拆台什么的，慢慢地他也承认了自己学不像……没人学得像，韩凌枫后来便不再模仿电视剧里的人说话了。

　　此刻，维克多的声音很清晰，没有一点异样，简直是完美无缺！

　　“喂，一起走吧。”

　　韩凌枫忽然感到一种正面的力量，他觉得自己也将有机会变得很好。

　　韩凌枫再一次登上了这辆车，轻微的点火声响起来，维克多开的私人医护车启动了，它在微微颤抖，快速地从车位里移了出来，开入了交织的城市街道，开入了茫茫的黑夜。

　　看着窗外巨大的阴影和自己的模样重叠起来，韩凌枫有一种自己正在踏入黑暗中的感觉。

　　不过也没什么关系了，自己……本就是半只脚踏入黑暗中的人。

　　韩凌枫沉默了。

　　很久了，韩凌枫躺在狭小的床铺上，手机屏幕温和地发着光。

　　此时此刻，那些微小的声音，车声、说话声、孩子的哭声都像挤海绵一样一点点地消失了，所有的东西都像是打上了黑色的漆。

　　夜已深了，韩凌枫心里的不安奇怪地都消失了——任何东西都是可以用时间和黑夜洗净的。

　　韩凌枫小时候白天在外疯玩，说话不经大脑思考，晚上睡觉时想起那些白天的片段，觉得自己做了好多好多的错事，把头都埋在枕头下面懊悔。

　　初中时韩凌枫觉得自己应该可以去离家不远的小教堂忏悔一下什么的，那里经常空空荡荡的一个人都没，又会在周末传来大声地唱诗声，不过后来因为被哪里的一个阿姨吓到，他就再也没去过，这个想法像是在他的脑子里凭空地消失了一般。

　　这应该不算是懦弱吧，自己是个懦弱的人吗？有时韩凌枫会这样想。

　　如果韩凌枫还有谁是他永不离弃，永不怀疑的好朋友的话，那便是这无边的夜色了。

　　大大方方的手机屏幕此刻染上了一层黑暗，韩凌枫把屏幕亮度调到了最低，那电池凭借30%多的电量也支撑不了多久了。

　　他躺在房车后的简易床上找不到事情做，车好像停了，维克多不知道在哪里睡觉。

　　之前心里有种预感怂恿着他把《应急外伤处理》快速地翻了一遍，然后就是完全找不到事情可做了。

　　他习惯性地打开抠抠，翻了那些狗血的说说。

　　“……以后我们要做完所有的姿势……”

　　“某某某生日快乐，多的就不说了哈，今天是一起走过的第X年……”

　　“24h秒赞平台……”

　　…………

　　跟自己一点关系都没有，韩凌枫看也不看，直接翻过去了，然后又无聊地打开联系人看了一遍，试着想想有什么思路。

　　但是一点思路都没有，会帮他忙的那几个人不在他的好友列表里，早就把韩凌枫给删掉了，或者是被韩凌枫自己给删掉了。

　　曾经也是在这样的深夜，韩凌枫迎着雪白的显示器，默默地把顾小曼的说说从头到尾翻了一遍，从小学到初中毕业，像是跨越时间地去看望她。

　　又是在这样的一个深夜，韩凌枫纠结地发了当天的第一条也是唯一一条“顾小曼生日快乐”，还全好友地求赞，但是最后看着那条苍白又乏力的孤单的说说只收到了可怜的三四个赞，又是怕顾小曼会生气，想要删掉，人家不是更会生气？

　　顾小曼自始至终没有提到过这件事，鬼知道她在想什么。

　　有时韩凌枫会发疯般地在朋友圈里找一个人，然后点掉“清除访客记录”有时他会翻出几年前的一篇帖子，一个一个地思考每一个出现的ID，即使当时它瞬间就石沉大海，有时韩凌枫把一个人几年的说说从头到尾地翻一遍，像是陪她走过了漫长的岁月。

　　有些东西很小却很重要，对你而言。

　　手机屏幕上弹出了电量不足的提示，韩凌枫再也找不到事情做了。

　　他的手机上只存有父母的手机号，而如今发生了这么奇怪的事情，韩凌枫的心里总是像有一个小小的声音在说：“不要给他们打电话……他们是多么危险啊……”

　　韩凌枫关了手机，四周的黑暗像雾一样又笼罩了整辆车，两米多的车顶此刻像是摔在土里的白面馍一样。

　　这两天发生的事情都太怪异了……无法解释的眩晕、陌生人、医疗爱好者、那恐怖的无名火……如果都加起来……不像是正常人会遇到的事啊！

　　那种不安又渐渐地占据了韩凌枫的身体，让他无法入睡。

　　夜晚，时间飞速地流淌，以那种不为人知的方式快速地溜走，气温在持续地降低，霜花沿着窗边在攀爬。

　　当你醒着时可能察觉不到气温的变化，但在你熟睡时，时间就像个会变戏法的家伙，它的魔力使你惊叹。

　　韩凌枫已经睡着了，不过就在几十分钟前，他还醒着的时候，突然很想有个熟悉的人在身边。

　　无论那个人是谁。

　　顾小曼也会有这种感觉的，是的，顾小曼是个女花痴，一有帅哥招呼她她就会头也不回地走掉，还把韩凌枫的故事当做笑话来讲，把她拍到的韩凌枫的尴尬画面和聊天记录拿出来秀的……

　　夜也沉沉地睡去了，整个车厢里只有韩凌枫的手机屏幕上绿色的LED灯间歇地亮着，带着颗粒感的绿色光芒在四处反射，像是有精灵在轻声唱着安眠的歌。

　　一

　　天空破碎了，狂风席卷了暗淡的海面。成群的海鸟飞过天边，这座岛屿快被吹散了。

　　韩凌枫在岛上，岛上有座旧公园。

　　公园废弃很久了，栏杆已经生锈，枯叶满地。

　　天空黑下来了，夜风刮着残叶，像是灾难后的废墟。

　　韩凌枫来到一棵树下，那里有个女孩。女孩扎着利落的马尾，斜刘海，脸庞洁白又空灵，她是邓秋离。

　　没有人说话，她抱住了他，女孩的身体很柔软。

　　她吻了他，感觉就像是温暖湿润的果冻。

　　静。

　　韩凌枫醒来时，天空微微泛红，朱梓在营地对面睡着了，很安静。

　　梦里的吻算是初吻吗？

　　我又怎么会梦到邓秋离呢？那是个很厉害的女孩子，她很可爱，可你能感觉到她眼睛里的淡漠，她的情绪不像是真的，即使她也很孤单。

　　翻来覆去睡不着。

　　他也发短信说过要吻顾小曼，而且说得很英伦风，然后顾小曼把他甩了。

　　想来很奇怪，不过顾小曼是个疯婆子，这就很正常了。

　　天空慢慢地亮了起来，其实他已经不想再逃了，再逃能逃到哪里去？一路上他们已经看到几座通信塔，甚至还有自动修建的供电站，无人驾驶的运载机来来回回，机械手臂有条不紊地运行着。

　　它们色彩暗淡，结构简洁有力，是建军的风格。

　　当时他的心脏几乎停跳了，这些已经超过想象太多。

　　建军的逆天程度总在刷新，想想几年前还只是跳远跳了五米。

　　后来天亮了，朱梓和韩凌枫继续漫无目的地逃亡，时不时绝望，时不时担心着维克多他们。

　　黎明到来了，地面有水蒸气蒸腾出来，所见一片白茫茫，这是很奇异的景象。

　　后来他们看到一个大裂口，隐约可见一座残破的塔，斜靠在裂口边缘，半截埋在土里。

　　看上去很诡异，他们不敢进去，于是走开了。

　　朱梓又哭了，她说着害怕，可韩凌枫一点办法也没有。

　　二

　　越狱两天了，两人深陷在一片汪洋的泥地里。

　　韩凌枫有些恍惚，他已经不太感到饿，只是满身伤和污泥，而且很冷。

　　有时觉得饿着挺好的，能忘掉很多事。

　　比如现在。

　　比如你喜欢的女孩拿你当备胎。

　　比如那女孩亲吻过的男孩们就在那座城市里，踏着你每天走过的大街。

　　他们晒着暖暖的太阳，他们发短信聊衣服什么的。

　　你烤着篝火，他们也在夜里相拥。

　　泥泞，韩凌枫想起贝爷的大冒险，也许试试嚼嚼虫子什么的也不错。

　　过了不知多久，韩凌枫忽然觉得没什么了，只是死掉那没什么。

　　单纯的死亡已经不能使你畏惧，只是消失了，那没什么。

　　“忽然很担心我的好朋友，那白色的小猎犬。”朱梓忽然说。

　　“它很弱小的，什么都抢不到，捉不到。除了我没人给它食物，它会很可怜的。”

　　韩凌枫忽然心里发酸。

　　“我们去那塔里看看吧。”朱梓说。

　　这是一座巨大的的圆柱形的塔，它的周围还有一些毁坏的小塔。

　　时至今日，仍散发着威严的气息。

　　塔的正面有一条触目惊心的大裂口。

　　他们走进裂缝，进入环形楼梯。

　　借着石缝微光，两人刚好能看清四周。

　　塔里到处是碎石，很多都长满了青苔，墙壁上也满是青苔。

　　它的下半截深埋在地底，楼梯往下通向一片未知的黑暗，两人朝上走去。

　　这里很多蜘蛛之类的生物，之前看到一只乳白色的大蜈蚣从他们头顶经过，韩凌枫吓得几乎要跑回去。

　　“没事。”朱梓抱紧了韩凌枫，把他的头埋在自己胸口。

　　温暖。

　　韩凌枫愣住了。

　　他的心砰砰直跳，没有那么害怕了。

　　朱梓说：“那个是有毒的，母亲拿它入药。”

　　“走吧！”她放开了韩凌枫。

　　韩凌枫像个木头一样呆愣在原地，然后连忙跟了上去，心里暖暖的。

　　到了顶层，有个几乎被巨石堵住的门，门后是一个大房间。

　　这里半个顶都塌了，废墟一般布满蜘蛛网。

　　隐约可见的六级台阶之后，靠墙有一把石椅，石椅上端坐着一具钢铁铠甲。

　　简直帝王规格。

　　光线穿透石缝，尘土漫天地飞扬起来，那具铠甲还带着斑斑的锈迹。

　　朱梓看到韩凌枫的手机时那表情像是看到天神下凡一样，韩凌枫心里爽歪歪，此刻她也是这种表情。

　　韩凌枫忽然想到不锈钢什么的，不过他一点不觉得好笑，这具铠甲出现在这个时代简直可以被尊为神，他可以拿来保命啥的。

　　可以看到铠甲上镌刻着某些文字，像是英文。

　　“Dancia“

　　韩凌枫晕了，这好像是个女孩的名字。

　　没太在意。

　　他想着也许会看到一具骷髅，可就在这时，铠甲竟然动了！

　　灰尘弥漫开来，铠甲转过头来看着两人。

　　韩凌枫的腿直哆嗦，他突然发现这样自己根本跑不动。

　　铠甲里传来沉重的喘息声，不知多久后，那里传来人声。

　　“你看到我丈夫了吗？”

　　那是个很老的女人，老得像干枯的木头。

　　两人吓坏了，韩凌枫挣扎着沿着原路逃走了。

　　韩凌枫忽然想起他们在破碎的楼梯里看到了一句句的骸骨。

　　那是他的丈夫吧？

　　她再也见不到自己的丈夫了，真的让人很难过。

时值二零一三年五月一日

　　夏日的阳光把地面烤得金黄，树叶的阴影像一个个张牙舞爪的小鬼，大家都躲在开着空调的小屋里或者公交车上，江林大道上空空荡荡的。

　　韩凌枫脚上一双夹脚鞋坐在路边玩手机，他那一身黑色背心花短裤的造型已经足以吓跑小孩子了吧，韩凌枫想到这儿笑了笑。

　　韩凌枫刚刚结束了他美好的十七岁，但却有些颓废，想一想也是，一个一年成绩掉了两百多分的人，能不颓废？或者是一年掉了两百多分这事，能不让人颓废么？

　　其实这也不能怪自己吧？韩凌枫这样想。

　　韩凌枫在手机上玩游戏，名字叫《口袋妖怪》。它最吸引人的就是你不知道下一刻会遇到什么东西。

　　他还小时同学们就在任天堂游戏机上玩这游戏了，韩凌枫没有游戏机，只能干巴巴地看。

　　“嘟！”手机里传来快没电的警告声，韩凌枫的手机只有2%的电了，叹了口气，他只得将手机塞回包里。

　　从有记忆起，韩凌枫的暑假便是这么过的，没有可爱的妹妹陪去逛个街，没有兄弟伙一起出去环个湖，自己躲家里玩一整天的游戏，也不觉得无聊，倒是挺舒适的。

　　天太热了，地面的水蒸气被大量地蒸发，远处看起来像是扭曲的，在空气中飘晃着。

　　其实这种慢节奏不费脑筋的游戏他挺喜欢玩的，一边玩可以一边发发呆，时间就这样过去了。

　　自己在别人眼中是什么样子的呢？是很傻很天真的，偶尔有人找你搭个讪你一脸惨白半句话都挤不出来的那种人吧？从来都不是是那种很吊的走到哪里都会有朋友帮忙的人吧？

　　韩凌枫初中时有一个很是要好的同学，最初他们是那种用一张卡吃饭的朋友，但是后来不怎么联系了，韩凌枫还在因为作业拼死拼活挤时间，偶尔看到他的电话了，打一个电话过去，这位老同学电话接得很快，说我在某某某呢，朋友在这儿的网吧工作，自己也去那儿打工，还不错。韩凌枫想说，你怎么老是在朋友那儿打工，吃住都不愁的，不由得觉得很是自卑。

　　想想自己还穿着脏脏的衣服和鞋子拼命想扶起试卷上那点可怜的分，好容易捞到个女朋友，如今跟人家吵架到现在她找上门来你还不敢去跟人家说话，自己还……不想了，这点事多影响心情啊。

　　地上有小孩随手扔的冰激凌棍子，融化的部分在绿化带上留下了一圈淡绿色。

　　远处一条大黄狗安静地躺在水泥地上睡着了，韩凌枫有时跺跺脚，那狗的耳朵会动一下。

　　自己从来都不是人群的中心，你很把朋友当做一回事，因为你本身朋友很少，你也不需要太多的朋友，而人家朋友到处都是，兄弟满街跑，人家也根本不把你当回事。

　　韩凌枫音乐的启蒙老师是初中时的班长兄。班长要去参加比赛啦，他很高兴地把电吉他拿到寝室里，虽然我们都觉得他本人没那把吉他好看，但是几个好基友都觉得挺不错的。

　　由于没有带电箱，他扫起弦来猫声猫气的，看他那吉他比人都重的样子觉得挺搞笑的。时候窗外的阳光很明亮，长长的走廊里安静极了。

　　“你是猴子请来的救兵么？”

　　韩凌枫手机铃声响了，传来红孩儿的喊叫声，他正准备吃唐僧肉呢。

　　韩凌枫觉得奇怪，自己是那种挂着手机十天半个月也没有人找的那种人啊，突然来个电话怪吓人的。

　　韩凌枫想起跟爸妈要买电话的时候自己拍着胸脯对饭卡发誓要好好对这个电话的，如今就像个砖头一样，只是没事还可以消磨时间。

　　他犹豫了一下，屏幕上显示着未知来电，总觉得如果接了这个电话生活会发生天翻地覆的变化，但是这种生活其实挺不错的，看喜欢的小说对喜欢的人发发花痴。

　　“……你是猴子请来的救兵么？”

　　挺坚持不懈的，看来不是闪电话的骗子，韩凌枫看着自己的手机。

　　初三毕业那年有一个女生到他家里来找他，韩凌枫帮她复印卷子。

　　说来也巧，她到的时候已经八点半，天也不早了，可韩凌枫才刚刚睡醒，爸妈都不在家，开门看到是个女生的时候韩凌枫吃了一惊，没好意思让人家到自己家里来，韩凌枫家是属于那种光都照不进去的一楼，来家里做客的人也少得可怜，自然也乱的慌。

　　那女生直接就被他的表情吓了一跳，脸红红的……后来的事也不用多说了。

　　有时候韩凌枫会想到自己一头乱糟糟的样子露着毛腿趴在床上捧着一个没人打电话的手机玩单机游戏，这个样子要是没被人看到……

　　“你是猴子请来的救兵么！”

　　韩凌枫不再想了，他按下了接听键。

　　电话里没有传来什么怪叔叔或者怪阿姨的声音，电话那头什么声音也没有，但是韩凌枫也没有挂电话，这样子持续了大概有二十秒，但是双方都没有挂电话，也许电话那头的人只是意外拨出了他的号码。

　　十三亿人，在这样一大群人里有个人这么就遇到你了，还是挺不容易的。

　　电话里还是没有声音，韩凌枫觉得自己应该挂电话，任何一个正常的人遇到这种情况都会挂电话，但他的手有点不听使唤，他没有动。

　　韩凌枫觉得这个性能还不错的小小的智能手机就像一个黑洞一样诡异，没有打电话的人，没有理由，电话里没有声音。

　　但是他总觉得电话那头有什么东西在观察着他，在世界的某一个角落里。

　　他疑惑了。

　　韩凌枫小时候喜欢翻爸爸妈妈的大书柜，里面有很多杂志。

　　有一本求上说有些人天生的直觉力就很强，这种能力会表现在很多方面，比如别人还未说话你就能知道别人想要说什么，再比如拥有预知电话铃响的能力什么的。

　　韩凌枫觉得自己天生就是这种直觉力很强的人。

　　初中的时候韩凌枫遇到了同学顾小蔓。后来有一天韩凌枫正在努力地拉大条，接到顾小曼的提议，说干脆在一起吧，简直天上掉下个林妹妹啊！

　　然后韩凌枫说好主意，于是韩凌枫恋爱了，时间长达一个月。

　　那时候韩凌枫拿着玩的还是个充话费送的小手机，话费消耗量从一个月不到十块猛然增加到一个星期四十块，险些被发现。

　　韩凌枫家里信号不好，晚上收发短信的时候得用手一直举着才能有一格信号，于是他就这么举着手机陪顾小蔓聊天一直到十二点多。

　　韩凌枫不敢开声音，于是就总是把手机放在自己能看得到的地方，几分钟去看一次，大多数时候，他总能接到短信。

　　有时对方愣了一下，好像很疑惑的样子。

　　其实韩凌枫自己也不知道为什么，他总是突然想起自己有一会儿没注意是不是有短信来了的时候拿起手机，短信便刚好来了，韩凌枫觉得，这是一种缘分。

　　那现在这个电话会不会是顾小蔓打来的呢？

　　韩凌枫想象过很多次这样的场景，顾小蔓还会给自己打电话么，如果真的有一天她又打电话给自己了，他一定会很冷很酷地抛下一句“我不认识你”，就挂了电话。而现在跟与她在一起的感觉就很像。

　　那自己会抛下一句很冷的话了吧？

　　“喂？”韩凌枫忍不住开口了，他发现自己的语调很软，到像是犯了错一般。

　　然后他就晕了过去。

　　黑暗中仿佛有聚光灯闪了一下，又似乎没有，眼前有黑影在摇晃，钝痛麻痹和窒息的感觉相继传来，耳边有凌乱的嗡嗡声，又像是一片寂静。

　　韩凌枫觉得这仿佛沉没在泥泞中无法挣脱的感觉难受得快要发疯一般。

　　不知过了多久，他终于感觉到自己躺在什么地方，地面很硬，很冰冷，不像是他所熟悉的床铺，倒很像是……手术台。

　　阴冷的寒意从脊椎很快地蔓延开来，韩凌枫觉得他的整个后背都像是沉在水中一般，随着时间的推移，四肢的知觉才慢慢地回到韩凌枫的身上，意识沿着四肢百骸蔓延开来。

　　不知过了多久，韩凌枫慢慢地睁开了双眼，映入眼帘的，却是明亮清新有着活力的白色车顶。

　　韩凌枫尝试着抬了抬手，沉重无比，索性韩凌枫什么也不做，脑袋一片空白，就这么躺着。

　　晕倒、陌生的地方、不能动弹，而现在这些条件都碰到一起了，韩凌枫知道自己十有八九是被绑架了。

　　这歹徒倒也是奇怪，自己家境一般，也不是什么大富人家，而他们偏偏会找上自己呢。

　　强烈的刺痛感和眩晕感如梨花带雨一般来临，耳鸣声像清脆的风铃在尖叫，韩凌枫脑海里只有蔚蓝的海面上白浪翻涌。四肢无力，意识像是散架了一样，感觉不到时间的流逝。现在他觉得自己就像是一只在海面上盘旋的水鸟。

　　意识要被……带离身体了，韩凌枫感到四周的地面在旋转。

　　他的思绪被打乱了，想起那个秋天，落叶铺了满街，金黄色。

　　那时的自己挥霍着时间，无知地一路走来，现在他什么也没有。

　　韩凌枫觉得过去的自己是一棵树，过去的时间把记忆的种子撒开，很久以后，思念才将它们催生发芽。

　　天地在快速地旋转，韩凌枫，感到什么东西要从喉头挣扎着出来。快吐了。

　　很多时候，韩凌枫承认自己是个没有远大志向的人，不过所有伟人的远大志向也不就是从无到有而树立起来的么？

　　韩凌枫这辈子想得最好的一件事就是定期到医院做全面的体检，每个月一次的各种体检。

　　健康地活着就好，这样哪天自己还可以去找找顾小曼……聊天什么的。

　　韩凌枫吐了，胃液混合着白色的尚未消化的食物被吐了出来，有那么一瞬间他意识到了现代医学可怕的一面。

　　黑暗中穿着带彩色可爱棉衣的女孩子抱臂而立……顾小曼常任性地说她就是那种刀子嘴豆腐心的人，她不知道的是，她的嘴比她说得还要毒。

　　“就这样活着吧？”顾小曼说。

　　“将军！派去东三城的斥候已超过了时间。怕是城已破。”是个没有名字，没有表情的斥候，房间里只有一个视角，但凭借豪华的木质结构的房间，主子暗蓝色带花纹的和服，便已经能看出这是战国时代的日本。只是哪一家势力，就真的看不出了。若是战国时期著名的织田信长、明智光秀等人，那都是各有特点，在任何电影游戏里都是着重强调出来的，你一眼就能看到他。

　　但在眼前这样重要的场景里，眼前的将军的确只是一位名儿让你记不住的不见经传的小人物，大众脸、光头，但貌似是个武力强悍的狠角色。

　　将军在泡茶。

　　“将军！入夜了！我们今天已经无法返回。”又是一名斥候，黑色身影稳健地单脚跪在门口，声音里没有语气，报完稍等了一会指示，便退下了。

　　冰冷的夜里，烧热的开水蒸腾出袅袅的白烟。跪在茶具前的身影，不动如山！

　　“之前侦查异样的东三郎副将，在夕阳将落的时候，消失在海边了，”远处隐隐传来那个又矮眼睛又小的贵族奸诈狡猾的声音，“一点音讯都没有，大名派遣我们前来调查，但是如今我们连敌人的影儿都没见到，东三郎大人已经……”

　　（大名：大名是日本古时封建制度对领主的称呼。）

　　天色越来越暗淡，东二城和东三城位于两座岛之间，临海，水体里保存的温度正化作暖暖缓缓的海风流向陆地，竹叶被海风吹动，传来轻微的沙沙声，听上去就像是恶鬼在嘶笑，瘆人心魄。

　　城上火光点点，城外大雾弥漫。

　　“之前驻守这里的夜五郎将军，也是莫名地消失了，只留下老百姓在城里，一觉起来城里的兵都没了，被吓得够呛。当地人说，事发前几天，城里的士兵就跟着了魔一样，禁止所有人上城楼，并且在夜晚还不点灯。这个季节，整夜都有大雾，不点灯，就像座鬼城……”贵族刻意压低了自己的声音，继续说。

　　“照你这么说，夜将军可是扰乱民心的大魔头啦？……”和他对答的，是一个军官的声音，勇猛又喑哑。

　　“哼！”原本正坐在凉席上的将军起身走了出来，浓雾都在风中被打乱，散尽了。

　　侍从赶紧为将军加裘衣，将军头也不回，径直走上城楼。

　　“随我上城。”将军站定了一下，背对着属下说，随后上了城楼。

　　“是！”

　　雾如墨，夜风疾！

　　将军在火光中眺望云海，顿时这座城就像在浓雾弥漫的大海中航行的超级大船一般，若有万钧之势。

　　可就在这时，异变出现了。

　　“雾里有人！”一名眼好使的士兵喊了出来，随后大家也都看到了那个在雾中出现的影子。

　　天呐。那是怎样的一个“人”啊，庞大的身影像是扛着某种古遗迹上的巨柱。这样算起来，这个家伙的个头得有十来米高，按常规的作战方式，士兵根本无法拿它怎么样。

　　“还有……一个……两个……天！数不清！”黑暗里有人吞着口水。

　　整座城都被巨大的黑影围住了，将军愣了有半刻，“熄灭火把。”

　　“熄灭火把！”命令被传了下去，再这样背水一战的时刻，这支军队表现出一种纪律性和效率。

　　整座城上的火把都灭了，一片黑暗，将军说不出话，他的眼里看到了难以置信的东西。乘着最后的霞光，那些巨大的身影下，密密麻麻的数不清的细小身影缓缓地从雾中走了出来。

　　从海底爬出来的怪物，以巨大的锁链为武器，极为难缠。如果你遭遇了它们，即使拥有良田万丈，兵车千乘也无济于事；即使你拥有这世上最快的马，也无法逃脱。

　　时值二零一三年五月二日

　　当太阳已经高过头顶韩凌枫终于是醒了，他很高兴因为昨天晚上做了个很刺激的梦。

　　不过刚刚躺了十分钟，再回想起这个梦便觉得真的是有够无聊的：做梦都能梦到玩游戏。

　　把手伸出来正准备翻手机，韩凌枫突然一凛！气温……凉飕飕的感觉！

　　这根本就是天气转凉啊！什么鬼天气，若是放到古代，肯定又是哪个大魔头崛起了，天现异象啥的，想像蒲松龄这类奇葩人物根本是忙都忙不过来，定是会找人喝茶喝酒，聊说鬼神去的。

　　不过韩凌枫也就是个心怀迷茫的平凡少年，今天是劳动节，学校里放假，他也就在家过着放假休息加写一大堆卷子的生活。

　　挣扎着从床上爬起来，换好衣服，拔了正充电的手机，韩凌枫走到客厅里去了，父亲正在客厅里看电视。

　　父亲面无表情地坐在沙发上，看着某部以剿匪为主题的电视剧，母亲在阳台上浇花。

　　“又冷又不下雨，窗上都是霜。鬼天气！”母亲一边弯腰给花浇水，一边道。

　　“咦？小枫你在家的啊，昨晚哪儿玩去了？电话也关机，给你说过几百遍，有些地方你一人去我们怎么好放心？你宋阿姨家王哥哥就是在晚上被人家伤了脚啊。”妈妈的身影隔着结着冰花的玻璃门，有些恍惚。

　　她做完了自己的事情，从玻璃门外走进来，看着自己的儿子。很难讲她的脸上是什么表情，严肃又好像那本没有表情。

　　愣了一下，韩凌枫才说:“我是去同学家了，还是他爸爸送我回来的。”

　　撒了个谎。韩凌枫觉得像这样的事跟爸妈很难解释，说清楚了，事情就变得复杂了。他觉得这样的事情他能应付。

　　一想起昨天的事，特别是晕倒，韩凌枫就觉得奇怪，怎么自己一年轻健康的少年就突然晕倒了呢？

　　想到这儿，韩凌枫一个激灵：该不会是自己充着电玩手机引起的吧？哎呀这事儿可说不准啊。

　　边想着这种开脑洞的难以有个结果的问题，韩凌枫边陪着父母看了一会儿电视剧。

　　“小枫，你可得好好学，把你那点分给提上来啊，才刚刚上高中，你还有这个可能的。”妈妈一边用手机上网一边说，“你爸爸像你这么大的时候，成绩可是全校最好的，现在你爸爸去开同学会，这也是大家公认的事实。”

　　正在看电视的爸爸拉动了下嘴角，老脸上做了个略带尴尬的表情。

　　这已经是韩凌枫不知道多少次听妈妈讲这句话了，这是在鼓励他韩凌枫，要打个兔子翻身仗。

　　可是韩凌枫觉得这有些可笑，父亲学生时代成绩是有多么好啊，可是现在说实话，并不是过得有多好——当然跟很多人比起来，也是过得不错了——可是从小到大，韩凌枫没有敢向家里要钱买过什么稍微贵一点的东西。

　　韩凌枫上小学的时候同学间很流行悠悠球，那时候韩凌枫每天的零花钱是一块钱，够买两袋那种最便宜的面筋做的袋装零食或者两串烤饵块，那时候韩凌枫通常玩的都是五块钱的塑料悠悠球，中心转动的轴大部分也都是塑料做的，可以说是非常经济实惠，只能大概让你知道什么是悠悠球，这东西的原理是什么，但是和真正的悠悠球不是一个概念，无论是什么爱好都是需要你去投入些什么的。

　　那时韩凌枫天天下课玩着这样的悠悠球，和同学交流自己是怎么玩的。

　　眼看着大家都换成了入门级的悠悠球了，可是小韩凌枫还是玩着自己的球，一种渴望在雨水的灌溉下渐渐长大。

　　后来的有一天，小韩凌枫终于鼓起勇气向妈妈提出要求说自己想买一个二十块钱的悠悠球，这是悠悠球的电视剧中主人公得到的第二个悠悠球，并且和它战胜了对手，距离全国冠军又近了一步时的，那个悠悠球，橙色的，精致又漂亮。

　　韩凌枫的妈妈同意了，韩凌枫很开心。这是韩凌枫买的最贵的一个悠悠球，在韩凌枫很开心地拿去和同学看时，同学拿出了个一样的，并且指出了这种悠悠球的缺点:绳连接轴时与两边的距离太近，不好上线而且容易产生摩擦，而小韩凌枫呆呆地练习上线。

　　事实上，直到现在，韩凌枫也不知道“泼冷水”是什么意思。

　　“韩凌枫是个好孩子。”大人们很少花很多语言去评价一个孩子，而熟识的婆婆们对韩凌枫的印象都很好。

　　那个悠悠球在一个星期之后就莫明地失踪了，但是韩凌枫没有没有哭，也没有在意过，他只是跟妈妈说他把悠悠球弄掉了，妈妈也没说什么。只是从此以后韩凌枫再也没有跟妈妈提起过要买什么玩具。

　　韩凌枫默默地坐在沙发边看了一会儿电视，就走进书房。

　　打开电脑，登QQ，韩凌枫在空间里写下一条说说。

　　“这世上有些人总是习惯性地穿得很乱，而有的人按习惯穿衣服就能穿得很合身很时尚。我觉得遇到你时我是第一种人，与你打交道后我变成了第二种。”

　　其下还附了一张网上搜罗来的衣着时尚的帅哥的图片，一看真是像极了那种转发率很多的高品质说说。

　　实际上没人转。

　　韩凌枫说的这段话其实是在讽刺初中时的某个同学，不过他们现在不是好友，所以他看不到，别人看到这条说说也根本不知道他在说谁，也算是没拉仇恨啦。

　　然后韩凌枫登陆游戏玩了一把，就开始放着动漫边写作业。

　　自从刚刚开了电脑，韩凌枫便觉得压力都排泄掉了似的。

　　其实韩凌枫不敢承认的是，他现在根本没朋友，他唯一的朋友就是这台老电脑。

　　韩凌枫整天都坐在电脑前。

　　这么久了，夜深人静时，是它陪你玩，放电影动漫韩剧给你看，陪你聊天，帮你找朋友，帮你找资料帮你想问题……

　　很久以来，韩凌枫觉得是这台老电脑在陪自己玩，很久以后他想通了，陪自己玩的，是做游戏的人。

　　笔尖在写题，像小鸡啄米。

　　午后被挡在在云层和水蒸气后的光照得这个世界发白，韩凌枫做题好像有了效率，速度很快。

　　韩凌枫把游戏继续下载了，一边写作业一边乱想，也许自己就是个无爱少年吧。

　　不争气的少年，尘世中呆了十多年，连吐槽都不会，成绩一塌糊涂。

　　又不会玩儿成绩又不好，韩凌枫奇怪自己这些年都是在干什么？

　　不知过了多久，客厅里一直很安静，只有电视剧中的人物对白的声音，都是拉兄弟啊，当土匪啊打县令啊……

　　“啪”！门开了，妈妈走进来。

　　“累不累啊？”妈妈说，表情有些奇怪，瘆得慌。

　　“……”

　　“我看你写了多少作业……”妈妈看向韩凌枫的本子，韩凌枫也看向自己的本子，上面只有半张是写了歪歪扭扭的题。

　　韩凌枫的妈妈很漂亮，染过的扎起的头发上有丝丝的白纹。也是因为韩凌枫的妈妈，他的长相还耐看，精心打扮后还是邻家男孩的风格。

　　有那么一瞬间，没有人说话，空气里的声音像是都消失了，韩凌枫觉得空气里的声音都消失了。

　　耳边，韩凌枫从未听到过的语气：“你就做了这么点？”

　　入坠冰窖。

　　“不是，我是在看例题……”韩凌枫下意识地说。他确实是在看例题。

　　“你知不知道为了你上初中高中你爸爸跑了多少地方？我们本来期望你有一点点的改变！”韩凌枫的妈妈满腔怒吼地说。

　　心里一凉，韩凌枫几乎要失去思考的能力。与男同学吵架，那是激动地手脚颤抖，但是与妈妈吵架，韩凌枫觉得就像是把自己扔在冰窟里的感觉，每一寸汗毛都要倒立起来。

　　在有所想法之前，韩凌枫已经推开椅子起身，走向书房外。

　　不对劲！

　　刚刚走到书房门口，只见附近正站在那里，二话不说就抬起手向韩凌枫脸上挥去！

　　“啪”！清脆的一声在房间里回响，韩凌枫的左边侧脸上像是撒了辣椒粉一样，火辣辣的。

　　韩凌枫呆滞了。

　　这什么情况？！

　　眼角余光一扫，父亲手上正拿着年轻时打鸟用的气枪。

　　它本是父亲的收藏品，平时就静静的放在角落里。

　　韩凌枫的父亲年轻时还打猎。

　　“妈呀！”韩凌枫立即做出了枪战片里明星的动作，猫着腰就向大门外跑去。

　　“嘭！”突然一声轻轻的枪响发出来，韩凌枫只觉得右腰的衣服传来一阵风，吓得连忙快速向楼下跑去。

　　楼道里静悄悄的，被韩凌枫推开的门迟迟没有动静，整个居民楼里静得像阴间一般。

　　自己的脚都因为激动不受控制地颤抖着，右腰的衣服破了一个大洞，见鬼了今天！

　　韩凌枫一直跑到楼下，才慢了下来，走出小区大门，他还属于呆滞状态。

　　这不是正常人该遇到的事儿啊，韩凌枫一辈子都没听说过这样的事情，父母……可是生养了自己的人啊，你的每一个动作都是父母教会的，你的每一个思想都是父母言传身教啊！

　　据说所谓艺术家穷尽一生仅仅只是在为另一位艺术家的作品写简介，她就是母亲，儿子是母亲唯一的作品。

　　韩凌枫觉得自己身边的事怪怪的，父母亲其实是爱自己的吧？应该是爱自己的吧？今天的事情怎么回事？这世界怎么了？

　　当你发现自己与世界不太一样了，那是不是说明他自己与世界不太一样了？

　　根本没有地方可去，自己随意而去的方向，是书店还有网吧。讽刺的是，书店和网吧居然在一个方向。

　　韩凌枫读初中时留过级，已经18岁，是可以进网吧的。

　　他在网吧里找了个位置坐下。

　　那是一个靠窗的位置，韩凌枫在里头坐下，过了一会儿了心不那么慌了。

　　瞟了瞟旁边那人，是一个青年男子，短碎发映衬着洗得很白的皮肤，胡渣也几乎看不见，是个有正当工作的那种人。

　　男子正在玩一款名叫《英勇战联》的游戏。这是目前网络上最流行的竞技游戏，一直是各种年龄段的用户都爱玩的游戏，男子的手法很是老练。

　　韩凌枫自己也点开《英勇战联》，玩自己的。

　　不知过了多久，下午了，旁边的男子已经不见，韩凌枫想起今天的事情，不由得叹了口气。

　　自己是从什么时候开始玩游戏的？好像是自己还很小的时候，观摩爸爸在一台同样是小小的旧旧的电脑上玩游戏开始的吧？自从自己大一点之后爸爸很少玩这么久的游戏了，可是韩凌枫玩的游戏越来越大。

　　对韩凌枫这般年纪的少年来说，父母就是……给你一切的那个人啊。

　　不得不说，韩凌枫这十几年的人生很是窝囊，被小妹妹欺负什么的，当时他并不在意，可是这时那些无害的记忆好像又翻滚着跑了出来，燃烧着。

　　身上的钱差不多只够通宵，银行卡里的压岁钱倒是多，但是放在哪里他自己根本不知道，出来的时候忘了带，又要怎么取出来？

　　明天又要怎么办？去哪里？就算带了银行卡，自己又能用多久？

　　每个离家出走的孩子都是要跑回家的，自己又要怎么回去？韩凌枫想不到，于是暂时不想了。

　　旁边坐下一个女子，韩凌枫趁队友换防时瞟了瞟，是个姐姐，看上去二十出头的样子，皮肤好，干练，有亲和力。

　　她正在玩《英勇战联》里一个女警角色，在游戏里蹦跶。

　　这个角色配合她现实里的样子，那烫染过的发质很好的中长栗色头发，很可爱的。

　　女玩家还戴着耳机一边玩一边小声地叫队友。

　　“这个辅助是笨蛋，居然带引燃……”

　　可爱的女子，让人想起顾小曼。

　　韩凌枫坐在靠窗的座位上，手臂都冻僵了。

　　他什么都没有做，他什么事也不想惹动也不动一下，继续玩自己的游戏。

　　天渐渐黑了下来，傍边的座位上一个人也没有了。

　　韩凌枫还是比较认同那个姐姐，话说人怎会比电脑好呢？

　　天渐渐黑了，韩凌枫关了游戏，玩得很艰难，接下来他不知道自己要去哪里，独自在这样的地方过夜其实不安全。

　　每一次到无路可走的时候，韩凌枫总是想象会有奇迹发生，突然穿越到游戏世界什么的，但是事实上，这样的事情从没发生过。

　　渐渐地，发现自己也不想这样的事了，没有人会注意你会珍惜你的，你没有值得让别人珍惜你的……东西。

　　忽然眼角扫到一个人，无声地站在他的身旁，一身白衣有些熟悉。

　　韩凌枫侧脸一看，居然是维克多。

　　维克多没有说话，还是一如既往地让人看不透的样子，一脸“终于找到你了”，疲倦的表情。

我们天生是矛盾的，若我和他同在世上，我就不可能开心;而他生来就被教导不把命交给任何人，即使是父母，他始终只能是个剥削者。
所以我想了个办法，我颠覆了这个王朝，然后把短剑的剑柄交给了他……

如果不是遇到她我可能也不会觉得外国文化这么有趣，三年过去了，再找到老熟人几乎已经不可能了，但偶尔还是会很想她。
但就是因为这样一个小小的理由，我似乎觉得，韩文是一门我必须去抽时间学会的语言吖。。

生物是最恶心的学科了
清洒 ：器官所需要的，不过是适宜的养分和化学环境。
如此一来，我们给了它这些，它就可以像正常情况一样地工作。
而这些养分当然最好是另外的器官来提供。
受精卵也并不是只能在人体内发育，只要一个健康的器官就好了。

清洒 ：【八月十七日小节】情绪也能在很大程度上影响我们做的事，说的话。
在某些时候，情绪能带来负面影响，因而创造此条件就可能造成负面影响。
可能的解决方案：1.把情绪作为考虑的因素，维持自己的情绪，可能会花精力去注意。
2.坚毅性格的人，情绪对他的影响很小。
3.做事讲原则，这样即使情绪不好也能做正确的事。

王巧玲说，初恋最让人难忘的夕阳下的拥抱。我就想啊，夕阳下哪里有什么拥抱哟，夕阳下……夕阳下是你背着大大的书包，踏着沉重的脚步；夕阳下是你和一群不认识的小孩围在路边摊；夕阳下是你孤孤单单地在空荡的操场上瞎晃，带着耳机听摇滚……你的生命还没升起，就落下了。

“梦想还是梦想！”解析：由于主语前面没有形容词，我们认为这个“梦想”即指说话者自己的梦想或者泛指所有梦想（通常情况下不会强调某第三人称）。则句子的意思是梦想并没有改变，由此引出了几个问题：一梦想原来是什么样？二梦想为什么会改变？三梦想会变成什么样？第一个问题，最初的梦想即是童年时期无忧无虑的猜想……

发型力学修正版。发型的作用1.会对周围人对你的映象产生推力，它是一个相互作用力，也会对你自己的心理产生影响，由于人与人之间情感的距离，答应对你自己的影响大于它对别人的影响。2.在你与朋友之间发生不良事件时，发型会对这个不良事件带来的反向推力有一定的抵消，甚至完全转化为其他形式的影响，它做功的快慢是取决于你发型的功率大小

我们将发型对周围人对你的印象的影响定义为发型产生的应力，则可以认为你的发型拥有发型势能。头发越长，你的发型所产生的力的功率的绝对值就越大，它的正负取决于你发型的好看程度。光头所产生的发型功率无限接近于零。当你的头发长度达到某个常数k时，发型对于你的发型应力大小影响非常大，且可能呈某种函数关系，待测定。所以我将k称为发型常数，单位为cm。k的值大小因人而异，就像每个星球的g都不一样，但是偏差应该不大。

【八月十七日小节】情绪也能在很大程度上影响我们做的事，说的话。
在某些时候，情绪能带来负面影响，因而创造此条件就可能造成负面影响。
可能的解决方案：1.把情绪作为考虑的因素，维持自己的情绪，可能会花精力去注意。
2.坚毅性格的人，情绪对他的影响很小。
3.做事讲原则，这样即使情绪不好也能做正确的事。

也许偶像的意义就是在你年少的时候，你唱他们的歌给你的朋友听，强暴某某某看MV……你一直说要去看偶像的演唱会，但是你发现好快的你就老了都没有人陪你去看演唱会……但是你在看电视是看到他们都还是会很认真的去看，他们是你的偶像。

映射]设A、B是两个非空集合，如果存在一个法则f，使得对A中的每个元素a，按法则f，在B中有唯一确定的元素b与之对应，则称f为从A到B的映射，记作f：A→B。
其中，b称为元素a在映射f下的象，记作：b=f(a); a称为b关于映射f的原象。集合B中所有元素的像的集合成为映射f的值域，记作f(A)。
注意：(1)对于A中不同的元素，在B中有不同的象；（2）B中每个元素都有原象，称映射f建立了集合A和集合B之间的一个一一对应关系，也称f是A到B上的 展开

　　一、韩凌枫

　　时值二零一五年九月，极阳。

　　今天的太阳出奇地大，阳台上的一束嫩芽焉巴着，看那有些蜷曲的小叶子，似乎也快要沦为她脚底碎黄中的一员了。

　　韩凌枫的就花盆里生活着各种各样的幼苗，不过一直很努力的南瓜已经死了，土豆没事，苹果的小叶子上有几个洞，不过似乎没有大碍，也不知道怎么回事，反正经常莫名其妙地死了就是了，韩凌枫看到那颗挺立着的小柠檬也快不行了，拿漱口的杯子，在厨房接了一杯水，灌了下去。

　　最近无聊到爆，韩凌枫试着种了一些植物，若是以后找不到工作，不至于饿死。

　　韩凌枫觉得，怎样都好，别跟人打交道，谁知道会发生什么莫名其妙的事。

　　他快读大学了，不是很出名。

　　打开手机漫无目的地翻看，屏幕上端跳出一则新闻来，标题是《2020年光棍危机》。那就像碳酸糖投入了水中，快速地冒出泡泡，然后韩凌枫陷入了巨大的恐慌。

　　不能再这样颓废下去了，是时候做点什么了！

　　二、据守！

　　他很少关心别人住在哪儿，除了顾小曼。

　　他以前帮顾小曼复印过报纸，虽说那次他差点死于车祸，不过也算是印象深刻，别的韩凌枫不太清楚，但他总觉得那次是很奇怪啊，那么突然地让自己送报纸，又不说明来意，不过他倒是很乐意。

　　这些日子，父母每天早出晚归，他没事可做时，就玩游戏、看电影，再到看电视剧，已经无聊透了，生物钟也完全打乱。

　　恍惚地走到街上，韩凌枫想，干脆去书城吧，在那些书海中找一本清淡一点的，若是很快就觉得无聊了，随时也可以回来，再不去街上瞎逛，买只小仓鼠啥的……

　　然后他就路过了那个岔路口，顾小曼家在里边。

　　如今他每次路过这里，都会扭头看看，并伴随着一阵恍惚。

　　这丫头没问题吧？整天神神叨叨的……是当初发生了什么事情吗？否则她会发那种神经？

　　她的妈妈骂了她么？她有什么样的苦衷吗？她其实也对自己的缺点感到无力吗…就像曾经的自己那样，那样的无助。

　　韩凌枫忽然不想去书店了，停在人行道上，不知道怎么办才好。

　　他看到那边路口有个小吃摊，摊主是个瘦削的中年人，有着点点花白的头发。

　　今天，自己就在这里呆吧。

　　三、时光如白马

　　其实自己在那儿白坐着，是很不好意思的，于是韩凌枫从包里摸了几张皱巴巴的零钱，向摊主要了点东西，摊主他丝毫没有不适的意思，于是韩凌枫也能心安理得地呆在那里了。

　　正午的太阳有些小了，看上去光照很适中，韩凌枫塞着耳麦听音乐。

　　自己，做事也不够好啊。

　　如果有成绩比你更好的，能力也比你强的人，有比你帅的，说话也比你动听的人，那为什么不去喜欢那个人呢？如果他很爱你，对你好，你又为何不与他相爱呢？

　　也许，根本的问题还是在自己身上吧，小时候也是这么想的，至少韩凌枫从小到大还没看到过比自己更着急的人……

　　韩凌枫闭上眼睛，习惯地用手和头发遮住半张脸，看上去像是石头做的。

　　时光如白马，一去不复返；时光如白发，噬咬着你的心。

　　四、日落

　　韩凌枫不知道自己能带到多久，电量过低时他关了手机，这是他的一个习惯，这样还有点去打电话救急。

　　期间摊主问他是大学生了吧，韩凌枫说自己高三了。

　　不想说话，不想动，不过肾还是得珍惜的。

　　后来天色渐渐变得有些橘黄，中年人收了摊，很快马路边只剩下个水泥柱，还有那些石椅，整个街道在初生的夕阳里飘晃着。

　　再有一个多小时，天就黑了，韩凌枫是不会在外边呆太久的。

　　还是回去吧，继续过自己的生活。

　　顾小曼从小就学钢琴，这也是她的特长啊，说不定以后她会非常的出名啊，成为像那些明星一样的人，这样韩凌枫每次看到她就回很难受。但是像她那样坏脾气的女孩，也许会很孤单呢，那么自己就去安慰她。

　　韩凌枫想着，表情一片严肃。

　　可就在这时，在那拐角处，有个样子很眼熟的漂亮女孩出现了，韩凌枫皱着眉头，然后差点没被吓死，那是她！

　　顾，小，蔓！

　　她比以前漂亮了很多，很像那些遥远的女神了，穿衣服也很时尚。

　　她打着电话，向马路的那一头走去了。

　　韩凌枫看看自己的衣服，马上把头别了过去，冷汗直冒。

　　又突然出现了，还是逃跑吧，自己已经很累了。

　　可她拿着电话的样子，却又有着一种神秘的力量。

　　五、淬火

　　韩凌枫最后还是没有直接走掉，他跟在后边，想着等到自己准备好了，就突然出现。

　　最后他就看到顾小曼和一个很帅的男生一并走着，吃火锅，逛街。后来天黑了，男孩和女孩挤在人群中买铁板烧，空气里散乱着霓虹灯光，音乐声。

　　在小巷里，雪白的路灯打在漆黑的路面上，在角落里，男孩吻了女孩。

　　韩凌枫就站在阳台外的走廊上，在那盏刺眼的聚光灯后边，没人看得到。

　　韩凌枫看着那两个漂亮的人渐渐地走远了，脸上没有什么表情。

　　半个小时后，韩凌枫回到家，很晚都没有睡着，于是拿起正在充电的手机翻看着。

　　有网友说，虽然现在单身男光棍有三千多万条，不过男子通常都会娶比自己年龄小的女孩的，所以光棍危机不会太糟糕的。

　　男子看着眼前的老头，恭敬地泡了碗茶。

　　“那么，建军是个什么样的人呢？”

　　在蒸腾的白雾里，老头惬意地眯起了眼睛。

　　缘起

　　在那个地方，知识被认为是“人”的诞生，没有知识便与家禽无异。

　　人家能把你吃掉，当然不会告诉你。

　　而学会从科学的角度观世界，才是第一次睁眼。

　　而这个孩子，从他第一次睁眼，就紧紧扼住了命运的咽喉。

　　守门人深知男孩的非同凡响，但自己表现得与往常一样，因为能说出口的都不重要，而重要的事，人们从不说出口。

　　尾声

　　一

　　他跑在雨里，思绪很乱，如果你遇到过这种情况你就能懂。

　　脑袋里总是莫名地冒出她说的话，你披着一件衣服发短信，手都在发抖，感觉不到冷。

　　你曾为她穿过拥挤的马路，你在手臂上刻下她的名字，鲜血流淌。

　　你为了她什么都不要了。

　　二

　　“我下了。”我输入。

　　好像也能表示“我下地狱了”。

　　是啊，我下地狱了

　　三

　　我叫韩凌枫…我也讨厌想起自己是天生的失败者。

　　城市是幅画，而我只是过客。

　　四

　　又是三年过去了，她不再把和新男友的照片发到朋友网，也不再让陌生人进她的空间，她不再系马尾辫，也不剪干净的短发，她只是把头发留到脸颊。

　　我不再纠结，因为最糟糕也就是那样了，不会感觉更糟了。

　　这是因为我变了，我忘掉了一些会伤害我的东西。

　　我习惯了，我迟钝，麻木，说好听些就是稳重了，难以因为外物而冲动。

　　哈哈我变稳重了，这样想来还不错。

　　五

　　我就在她身旁，我就在她身旁。

　　我知道我很讨人厌，但是我下意识地，就想去靠近她，我在人群中寻找她，默默地走在她身边。

　　如果发生了什么，或许我就会毫不犹豫地守在她身前。

　　现在她就坐在我身边，虽然我注定失败。

　　我在一页纸上写下一个公式，这是我平生第一次感到有些不凡的东西。

　　这是傅里叶公式啊，哪怕是最基本的，也足以让我处理声音的频谱。

　　我忘不了你话里的忧愁，你忧郁，又实在。

　　如果我能再造一个你，也就不会再打扰你了，我和我的诅咒，就能结束在我这。

　　不简单，也不难。

/fst/sky/moon-river/Zero. About/The Dreamer.txt



　　时值二零一三年九月

　　你是我心里的地窖。

　　我抓着酒，

　　火光开始飘摇。

　　邓秋离

　　窗外阳光明媚，绿叶飘在蓝天里，邓秋离把书都收好，整齐地放好，确认很美观。

　　邓秋离在教室里的所有时间几乎都在写题，她对这种劳动没感觉的，好像是呼吸，是生命的一部分。

　　同桌已经睡了两节课了，小平头上的汗流了下来，散发着一股怪味儿。

　　对于他来讲，邓秋离是他最搞不懂的人之一，就像个躯壳，而她的精神是活在数字里，在那些铅字组成的迷宫里。

　　邓秋离对于未知的事情有一种敬畏，微小的差错对她而言是种打击。

　　就像那个男孩出现时，她不可以丢脸。

　　默默地心算了自己的状态，邓秋离开始有一些安心，而同桌睡得跟死了一样。

　　一分一厘

　　又是能晒着太阳的周一，邓秋离的校服像是新的，天蓝色暖暖的，邓秋离喜欢这种感觉，天空都像是洗过的。

　　这座城市里的男生很漂亮，皮肤很白，很有小聪明，他们学着明星的样子留着头发，学素描、钢琴、吉他……

　　邓秋离记得小学时班里也有个男孩会弹吉他，可他说话女声女气的，还偷穿自己的衣服，脑袋像个坚果，贱贱地笑笑，看起来像个小丑。

　　可大城市里的男生不一样了，那是完全另一种感觉，他们穿着名牌的干净衣服，每天用洁面乳洗脸，话很多，可听起来很怪。

　　他们就像一只只小刺猬，充满了敌意，也不会让你知道他们在想什么。

　　唯有一个人例外。

　　每周一时，邓秋离和三五成群的同学走过广场去上音乐课，会与他擦肩而过。

　　那是一个有着柔软头发的男生，皮肤很柔和，穿着白色的体恤衫，他的发色似乎有些淡金，让人觉得温暖，就像是有阳光在他身上生根发芽了，散发着看不见的温热的光。

　　他看起来很忧伤，好像永远都不会快乐。

　　邓秋离总是感觉世界变得很安静，嘈杂声都被吞没了。

　　她像往常一样埋着头，紧张地走过。

　　她的身后有个长发女生环抱着手臂，正无事可做，看到了这一幕，打断了身边姐妹们的对话。

　　“每次看到那个男生，邓秋离就会低着她那傲娇的聪明脑袋耶。”

　　一分二厘

　　初二过了一半，邓秋离的数学成绩依旧是全校第一，还是很勤快地帮老师清理每天的作业，像是那种天命的学神，对那些还在恍惚着的小男孩小女孩来说，邓秋离是比天还高的存在。

　　邓秋离最近做事特别来劲儿，心里那条河欢快地蹦跳着。

　　她加到男生的扣扣了，是那种网上搜罗的很唯美的头像，昵称是“雨点“，说话很谦虚。

　　他很傻很幽默，偶尔会跟邓秋离开个玩笑，邓秋离觉得，世上最幸福的，就是与喜欢的人相爱。

　　她每天会打开空间看朋友们的状况，那个长发女生发了一条说说，却让她觉得有些不安。

　　”有一种病叫幸福，只有爱的人才能给你温暖。“

　　一分三厘

　　邓秋离坐在前排墙边的座位上，埋着头写练习册。

　　不知道为什么，男生不跟他说话了，天天和那个长发女生打闹，女生拿了他的东西，他们就相互打闹，追逐。

　　他们的成绩徘徊在中下游，邓秋离每次去找男生说话，他却用一双黑色的眼睛瞪着自己，像是黑夜到来，再没有那种温暖。

　　男生在空间里发说说。

　　“爱是你的唯一弱点，是不可遏制的心痛。”

　　邓秋离的脑子很乱，想着那个男孩在阳光下的样子。

　　心里想着他怎么可以这样恶毒。

　　一分四厘

　　很久了，男生已经莫名地把自己删了。

　　邓秋离面无表情，看着在“可能认识的人”里出现的那个id。

　　扣扣号码头几号与后几号吻合，好友印象和签名风格吻合，是那个男生，昵称是“黒吉他“。

　　那个男生在高三那年转走了，从此渺无音讯，邓秋离不敢加他，少有的，不知道怎么办才好，也许哪天就看不到了。

　　最后她复制了这个扣扣号码，它在加密后变成了一长串数字。

　　邓秋离就把它粘贴进了自己空空的留言板里。

　　邓秋离，十八岁，特长是她想守住的秘密没人能知道。

　　后来，她也试过用小号小心地加男生的好友，可总是没回音。

　　就当你睡着了，那我就等你醒来。邓秋离想着。

　　二分一厘

　　邓秋离高一了，实在太无聊，数学作业已经写到了一个骇人听闻的程度了，再写怕会引起轰动，而且反复地看同样内容的书也是没劲的。

　　若是再进一步，看看高端的三角函数啥的，怕还是会引起轰动。

　　邓秋离，双眼四百度，妈妈说长大后都不敢做手术。

　　邓秋离想，也许找几个闺蜜吧？可同学们看到她像看到怪物一样，都抱着敬而远之的态度。

　　无聊无聊无聊，打坐入定吧，无聊透顶啊

　　二分二厘

　　邓秋离偶然看到一则资料，当你在睡前构思一个简单场景，反复回想，连续几天，你就可能梦到它。

　　这个好，有点神棍，比较神奇，可能做到。

　　邓秋离设计了一个水泥墙小屋，长宽各一米，高两米，还有一盏白炽灯。

　　于是她每天睡前都在回想那小屋的结构，水泥墙触感，白炽灯的光……好几天了没成功，不过生活有趣多了！

　　三分一厘

　　不知过去了多久，邓秋离沉醉与数学，以及庞大的计算机内核中。

　　每天都要听着舒缓的歌才能睡得着。

　　这天她看到了一首魔性的歌，鬼魅般的声音，整首歌回荡着相同的旋律，他就这样睡着了。

　　睡梦中，她梦到自己是福尔摩斯。这世界里回响着那鬼魅般的歌声，几分钟一句。

　　那天她惊醒了，眼中满是难以置信，睡梦中的时间真的会慢很多吗？

　　三分二厘

　　高中了，班上开始有学生逐渐意识到，人类的思想分为表层意识、潜意识、深层记忆。

　　邓秋离听说了，忽然觉得这个世界很飘摇。与自己形影不离的数学、物理、其他科学，居然没有提到哪怕一点心理学的知识。

　　好像自己这几年来昼夜学习全走错了。

　　她了解到，人的表层意识是有存在时间的，短期记忆时没提到，这些意识就会存入深层记忆中，等待相关记忆激活时联想到相关内容。

　　她暂时还没有告诉任何人，这个信息与其他事物有无限多的关联，在表层意识的不断遗忘与激活下，就会引发不同的想法。

　　比如电脑内存与硬盘的关系类似于此，就会造成有一群人认为她是玩电脑沉迷了。

　　说不是他们就会认为是在袒护真正沉迷的人……

　　比如这些平常大家都不说，就会出现一群人认为这是疯言疯语。

　　说不是就会出现一群人认为所有精神疾病患者都是无辜的……

　　比如这样子一介绍就会出现一群人认为这些是煽动……

　　这些都是表层意识不断遗忘与激活形成的判断。

　　现代社会正在脱离丛林法则，合作是新的道路。

　　表层意识的容量大，持续时间长，能让这个人对于外界环境的判断更准确，能让这个人的生活更加稳定，不易受到误导。

　　三分三厘

　　踏入构建梦境的世界之后，邓秋离意识到睡眠与意识有很大的关联。

　　睡觉有时做梦，做梦内容与最近的记忆有关联，梦境内事物间关联不强，逻辑不强，判断迟缓，不易记忆。

　　从逻辑上判断，这是因为最近的记忆正在被弱关联地提取出来，放到熟睡的意识中。

　　这很可能是做梦的基本原理。

　　为什么睡觉时，人脑要将最近的记忆提取出来？

　　又走到死胡同了。

　　Helen

　　我还依稀记得那小巷里的风景，有和蔼的摆地摊的人，很多和我一般年纪，却又和我完全不同。

　　如今那里已经空了，我也没有时间再去想这些事情。

　　只是不经意间回想那画面，却已至此。

　　我的王啊，我为你准备了皇冠，你却不想要。

　　那么，我就自己戴上它。

　　我是海伦。

　　First.

　　这是一间有些年头的酒馆，木地板上布满了黑色斑点。

　　屋顶吊着老旧的铁制烛台，那火光微微亮着，房间里一片昏黄。

　　大厅的正中间，一群衣着华贵的少男少女正围坐着。

　　桌子上放着一杯酒，它有着葡萄酒般的性质，却更加剔透明亮。

　　鲜艳的暗金色，让那高脚杯好像盛了一碗火。

　　其中一个高个子男孩很开朗，他正摩拳擦掌想要试试眼前那杯酒。

　　他身旁是一个个子很小的男孩，他看上去很担心，生怕自己品尝不到了，可却害羞地不敢说话。

　　火酒，来自远方的部落，每一杯，都价值连城。

　　这一桌小公子们，攒够了零花钱，才换来一杯。

　　于是他们才来到城中最老派的乌鸦酒馆，品尝一下这神的贡品。

　　高个子的少年名叫斯特拉，矮一点男孩是特伦。

　　海伦浅浅地笑了，看着他们，她姣好的脸颊像海面倒映的明月，让人难忘。

　　戴思雅坐在她身边，看上去很紧张。

　　别的女孩眼里都多多少少有些秘密，那种处心积虑想要掩埋的秘密。

　　谁没有秘密呢，只是海伦更加天衣无缝。

　　女孩们都想着怎样培养男孩子们，是的，你要怎样面对他们，让他们变得更好。

　　Second.

　　世界上有无数关于神的书籍。

　　西方世界的伊国主要有两本，一本是《神典》，这本书记载了世界的一切，是一本从开始到结束的书，一切的基础，所有公民都会阅读。

　　另一本则很少有人知道，名为《恩泽》，这是心灵澄澈的修女才能领悟的。

　　其实，读过这本书的，全世界只有数十人而已，而且很多只是一面之缘。

　　其实呢，海伦自己就读过，而且背得滚瓜烂熟。

　　重要的部分来了，这两本书有很多种读法，按照一般小说的思路来读，它其实跟前一本差不多，是以神话表达了善良和勇敢这些高尚的品格。

　　第二种读法是要很多乡绅才懂得的了，故事里出现的方法，它们是重点。

　　比如捆绑其实是代表限制，比如忽悠或者装作不知道强行破坏某些关键环节。

　　比如复活的力量代指东山再起，或是使人鼓起信心的方法，惩罚恶人的力量代表使他们不能得逞最终失败的方法。

　　再比如书中说恶魔发现了圣子，并试图杀死他，圣子利用一块石头骗过了恶魔，并召集英雄杀死了恶魔。

　　在第一层意思中，这代表了勇敢善良的品质；在第二层中，这代表当你这些方法被发现后，用某种方法迷惑坏人，再召集同伴，灭了他。

　　这样，乡绅们就能用这些方法自保，让社会稳定下来。

　　世人以为到这里就结束了。

　　其实《恩泽》还有很多的读法，精密得仿佛某种机械。

　　这才是它有别于前一本的地方，它们生来不同。

　　而海伦，只不过是刚刚涉猎。

　　Third.

　　一切都结束了，夜幕降临。

　　少爷、公主们都乘着马车回去了，海伦站在阴影里，喝下一杯清澈透明的美酒。

　　“海伦小姐，您今晚也要去教堂吧，圣母大人会等侯您的。”一位修女说。

　　“是啊。”海伦的语气很认真。

　　她每天只睡三四个小时，据说这种睡眠方法是古代一位学者发明的，这在《秘典》中被描述为“亚当夏娃偷吃善恶树上的苹果”。

　　这种方法在一些旁支典籍中也有记载，比如希腊神话中的金苹果。

　　马车踏上熟悉的白沙路，海伦知道，自己到达目的地了，她得转移自己的注意力，把这些想法放到意识底层，不引起别人的注意。

　　这种方法在东方被以“冥想”、“道法自然”隐喻过。

　　老爹老了，脸上的皱纹像一条条裂缝。

　　老爹身体不好，年轻时熬夜太多，双眼布满血丝，胃也不好。

　　老爹老了，容易被豺狼盯上。可能被年轻的流氓侃晕，可能被作为韩凌枫的软肋要挟，可韩凌枫会照顾他。

　　可谁能留得住时间？我们终将回到一切的开端。

　　最后他谈成了，要把老爹送到美国去，老爹不肯走，韩凌枫麻醉了老爹，并且答应他，他不会让家人都离开的，他们一家都会活下去。

　　老爹被送到美国，接受全身冷冻。

　　我叫程晨，我爸是铁匠，为军队制造武器。

　　我妈则是佣人……这也没啥好说的，我只是芸芸众生里最平凡的那一类，所以我每天都把自己的事情做到最好，我相信我已经成为了一个合格的老百姓，这也是唯一能让我满意的事。

　　十多岁时，我结了婚，我的妻子来自外省，因闹饥荒嫁到我家，勤劳努力，父母对儿媳妇也比较满意。

　　二十多岁后，我也很顺利地接手了父亲的工作，为军队打造兵器。

　　我觉得我还是蛮靠得住的，必要时发下火，还是能承受大量的工作。

　　直到有一天，我受到了来自本地高官的排挤。

　　我很气愤，但也无路可走了，我干什么都不对，于是我开始潜心钻研铁匠技术。

　　现在想来，我不用那么着急——我是一把手，这种程度的排挤不会把我怎样，因为没人能接替我的工作了，我只需要保证我的工作。

　　可我不知道，我去研究铁匠了，军队的工作也荒废了，上面以为我变坏了，不再用我。

　　我也就成了浪人铁匠，父亲不再见我。

　　一天夜里，我正在酒馆喝酒。

　　江城夜里灯火通明，火光在江面蜿蜒。

　　我已经享受整整了一年江城的慵懒繁华，家产已经被我败光，还有几个月我就得搬回老家了。

　　这时，我注意到一个年轻人。

　　他的黑发很短，斜搭在眼前，皮肤很白很干净，看上去竟然比歌楼里的姑娘们还要漂亮。

　　“老师傅，您还做铁匠吗？”他径直走过来。

　　说到铁匠两个字我就气得喘不上来，而且我完全不认识他。

　　“你没毛病吧？”我皱着眉头说。

　　他竟然看着我，他的眼神在烛光里显得通透明亮，洞悉一切。

　　整个书桌乱得一团糟，我觉得以后可能有用的东西我都留着，导致两平方的平面上好像迷宫一样，还有发生危险的可能。

　　最近的生活像是在夏天的时候呆在飘摇大雨里的面包车上，四周都是嘈杂声，有花了眼的轿车按着喇叭使劲地尖声吼，也有雨中的行人在疯跑，自己在满是雾气和水滴的玻璃窗里，不知道下一刻会遇到什么。像这样的天气，要出去的人是个难事，要回家的人也是要遇到诸多的困难，你甚至不能出门去找你爱的人！这样的瓢泼的暴雨，第二天就会天晴了吧？

　　天晴了我就可以去街上走，去工作、拿工资，去买吃的，去找我喜欢的人。心里的雨天下得比夏天的雨还要大。

　　现实是，冷空气入境，寒冷的天气导致空中水蒸气含量少，天气冷得不像话但是一点雨都没有，风刮在脸上生疼，这是要席卷你的水分。

　　黑夜像火焰一样蔓延开来，笼罩着所有的树，无月，只有大地上寒冷的灯光。

　　创世更新时间：2014-12-2114:06:28字数：1177

　　2014-12-21：第一章，增加了韩凌枫的昏迷状况。第二章，韩凌枫苏醒后反应不合逻辑，稍加内容。

　　2015-1-1:第一章引子部分有逻辑错误，逃入荒野的一队人，首先面临的最大困难就是饥饿。

　　2015-1-2：第一、二章中有多处猪脚名打错，已经修改。第三章开头不太扣情节，还没有想到应该如何修改；后文韩、维两人的交谈中，抓住谈话走向的人应该是老练冷静的维克多，已修改。

　　2015-1-5：第四章由“突变”更名为“四面楚歌”。情节渐渐趋于丰满和复杂，出现种类更多、数量更多的错误。后来又修改了标点符号和一些“镜头”指向的细节。

　　2015-1-10：第一章引子中增加了少量细节，总觉得不够友好，不能吸引人。

　　2015-1-12：第四章中为韩凌枫增添了少量心理活动。（PS今天有人去世了，天气太冷了）

　　2015-1-19：第二章中韩凌枫的对白太那啥……太女神了，修改之。

　　2015-1-29：刚发的第五章中修改了一些形容词

　　2015-1-22：第四章中增加了少量细节，增加了韩凌枫的心理活动，可以说能突出他的性格和心理状态。

　　2015-1-25：第三、四章中增加了少量细节。

　　2015-1-27：第二章中增加了细节。因为人对自己未知的东西总有一些奇怪的不熟悉感，这点在之前韩凌枫没有表现出来。第一章不太友好的感觉，不知道读者会怎么想，我自己读来都是很乱的感觉，应该重写的，只是之前稍微整理了一下。

　　2015-1-30：调整了第五章中建军的人设，建军是配角，而且他是有一些秘密的人，所以调低了他的存在感，他应该是那种幽灵一般的天才人物。

　　2015-1-31：修改了第五章中戴思雅·伊丽莎白的人设，她是一个皇室边缘血亲，究竟是不是算作贵族很难讲，所以她才不受重视，才能跑出来。

　　2015-2-16：第二章有少量修改。

　　2015-3-17：修改第二章中韩凌枫与Victor的对话，因为韩凌枫是那种思路不太清晰的野孩子一般的人，所以说话快、说话冲且不经大脑思考，在这种突然的情况下他保持不了那种女神般的气质。总是觉得想写的内容不完美，不敢面对什么的……最近世界观有些改变，感觉整个人眼界和以前不太一样了，感悟也很多；发展之前的章节中有很多的缺点，我应该更加用功才是啊，所以……希望接下来的章节会让看过的人觉得喜欢。

　　2015-3-19：第一章与第四章中韩凌枫的设定有所冲突，韩凌枫是刚刚满了十八岁，修改之。

　　2015-3-20：修改了第五章……一个错别字。

　　2015-3-29：将第一章中的引子部分去掉了，准备在之后由插叙的方式放出来。

　　2015-4-18：思考后还是把第一章的引子给加上去了，增删了一些细节。一直觉得不妥的第四章也略有增加。本想把这本书无限制地写下去，但是最近想到了一个道理：那就是小说不一定要写多长，但是要写到自己满意为止，尽到自己的最大努力那样才能无愧于心。

　　第六章中修改了部分细节。

　　致亲爱哒读者

　　创世更新时间：2015-01-0517:17:18字数：362

　　我不知道有多少人看了我的小说（耶！），但是总之我自己是不可能点两百多下的啦。

　　最近觉得自己思路越来越开阔，越来越能把一个世界完整、有序地展示出来，就是细节上往往出现会出现一些问题，我还要学会修改！

　　最近看了一些小说写得很不错，第一时间就抓住了我的注意力。

　　《无限进化之最强王者》末日之后的景象描写得就像我自己亲身体验一样！

　　《地球OL》一口气看了三十来万字，感觉很好！

　　同时，对于我自己的小说，我也有一些发现和问题！

　　随着剧情渐渐丰满和复杂，我感到自己驾驭文字的功力还不够，常常出现错误还要多次修改，而且修改的次数和涉及的章节往往比较多。

　　有一瞬间太猴急，写出来的剧情走向就不合逻辑，就感觉人物不像个成年人啊啊

　　我还有不短的路要走啊啊，我还要多多练习，故事架构的方法，人物塑造的方法什么的，能不能帮到我呢？

　　一打字就走火……总之，很感谢大家！

　　成功上传封面！

　　创世更新时间：2015-04-2213:58:29字数：142

　　熬了一通宵终于搞出了这张图来，眼睛痛痛痛！！！这样下去会不会成高度近视啊啊啊啊！！！周日上传后果然很快就有了。虽然是一夜辛勤的结晶，不过奈何本人技法有限，目前来讲能做到这个程度自己还是觉得惊喜的。

　　不过……我每次看到我那不协调的色调就觉得有点堵，希望大家见谅……啊。不过我会继续努力的！

　　遭遇大质量天体

　　创世更新时间：2015-05-2713:52:13字数：117

　　最近好像情绪比较激动啥的，晚上睡不着白天做事也很烦躁，感觉好像遭遇到了某些莫名的事情，自由自在的感觉已经找不到了，我不想太监，也不愿中断我的情感探险，写这本书的想法是我狠无聊的时候想到的，在每个夜晚它都在慢慢地长大，我是舍不得放手的！

　　我很难过

　　创世更新时间：2015-10-1623:57:18字数：285

　　今天仅需不太稳定，做了一些很傻的蠢事。

　　我做了一些很傻的事，说了一些很傻的话，我不帅，我很傻，那样的话认真起来就会很好笑吧？

　　韩凌枫已经遇到朱梓了，会有什么样的事发生呢？

　　维克多成了肩负责任的人了吧，他会始终走下去。

　　邓秋离的心冷得像座冰雕。

　　橘子男又发生意外了。

　　谁知道老涛在想什么…

　　你们会成功吗，会和我一起走完这段路吗？

　　夜幕又下来了，出奇的安静。明知道很伤眼睛，却一点也不在乎。若是始终这样，这双眼睛看不到真正的光，它也会很失落的吧。这个男孩又会掐掉那些歌，尽管它们是被很用心地写出来的，男孩也会一个人发呆。

　　我真的很难过，想乘着晚风，乘着黄昏下那些鸽子的尾羽，到更加遥远的国度。

　　你看到那玄幻的世界了吗

　　创世更新时间：2015-11-0713:43:50字数：363

　　这书似乎与玄幻一点关系都没有，一想到这个我连头都抬不起来，总是在想自己是不是很不负责任。

　　既然选了玄幻，却不好好钻研，连玄幻是啥都不知道，已经开头了……

　　不过也没规定玄幻怎么写啊……

　　那你为啥不写科幻……

　　额，我确实要写玄幻的，可是……

　　玄幻究竟是什么？

　　韩凌枫只是个普普通通的少年，每天玩手机玩游戏，有堆成山的作业，他怎么会知道玄幻是什么呢？

　　我也不知道玄幻是什么，可是它一定是存在的。

　　我很早就看了玄幻的小说，主人公从练外功到渡雷劫开始修真，最后成仙，甚至超脱世界，成为无上的存在。

　　我自然知道这是幻想…

　　（把小说当成现实八成是走火入魔了……）

　　可小说里的仙山云岛是什么？灵力仙气又是什么？倘若只是普普通通的幻想，会让人以百万字去诠释吗？

　　我相信命运在冥冥之中操控着你，也相信这世上没有做不成的事。

　　我知道有一天我一定会得到一个答案的，韩凌枫也是。

　　写故事还是写小说

　　创世更新时间：2015-11-2200:43:36字数：412

　　我一直当作故事来看，后来我开始幻想，开始构思小说，开始写小说，都是把小说当作故事的。

　　老师讲小说是一种虚构情节的文学体裁。

　　我开始写小说了，发现小说应该属于故事，但故事并不都能被称作小说。就像父母教会我们说话，识物，辩是非，我们在看书，游戏，交谈时也是在认识这个世界，我们无时无刻不在积累经验，我们随时都在学习。

　　所以我们看到的，听到的，都会带给我们一些记忆，一些经验，一些习惯，不好的故事可能会带来血腥的快感，暴力的性格。

　　作为一个作者，能随意地发文，然后全世界都可以看到你写的东西，你若放纵自己的物欲，追寻快感，是会造成一些后果的。

　　小说并不完全等同于故事，它带来的是好的精神品质，应该是作者从生活中积累来的。这些文字应该经过细心的雕琢，精心准备，是作者所珍惜的。

　　因为你的思想会传播给看到它们、听到它们的人，它们是否会唤醒坚强、勤劳、正义？会不会传播着虚伪和自私？我又能否克服它们呢？

　　我想，循着细心、谦逊、勤奋的路子应该不会错的。

　　白天开着黑夜的灯

　　创世更新时间：2016-01-0703:23:33字数：514

　　最近我变得很不同了。

　　我读了《乔布斯传》，我开始学着他一样画电路图，我听摇滚画速写，我想唱却无能为力，画得像个小孩子一样；我试着节食，甚至像他一样绝食，我在厕所吐得稀里哗啦，好像整个人的胃都搅在一起了，可我并不觉得痛苦。

　　这世上有许多事，比这，要更加痛苦的多。

　　可我发现我还是那个发泄情绪的小孩子啊，我想做的事还在那里好好的呆着，我甚至连自己都找不到了，我忘了韩凌枫的感受，我丢掉了那个孤单的，在夜里玩单调游戏的男孩。

　　他的梦想，他的痛苦，他喜欢的女孩，我都想不起了。

　　我想我需要再看一遍最初的第一章，可我发现我竟然删掉了最初引子的大部分，那些事被我彻底地遗忘了。这与被女孩们删掉的感觉不同，我一点没有失落，我只是不知道那时候我怎么了，那个男孩，是怎么能够多么多年发呆，熬夜，沉浸在小说或者无趣的老游戏里，天天想着女孩，那么多年啊！

　　那么多年啊……

　　那是白天开着黑色的灯，忍受着自闭少年们奇怪的思绪而过来的，我怎么可以忘掉他。

　　他还在天台，在广场，与同样饥渴的人，找着笑话，麻醉自己的灵魂。

　　那些画面都变成了快镜头，可永远都不会停止，后来一段回忆就变成了一幅画，你把它从心里剥出来，挂在墙上，你的心就空了。

　　那幅画的名字，就叫《白天开着黑夜的灯》。

　　明月

　　创世更新时间：2016-01-2001:46:35字数：160

　　一

　　这是一片寂寥的夜空，我浮动在明月之下，冷光跨过千万光年，与我遥望。

　　我什么都没有，连形体都没有。

　　我从不担心死亡，就算某天真死了，又能如何？

　　活着对我来说没有意义。

　　但是有天，我看到了头顶的月。

　　那是什么？我很想知道。

　　二

　　夜空是巨石，拖着我往下坠。

　　整个世界都在阻碍着我。

　　我时而停止，时而更加疯狂地向上而去。

　　直到某天，我看到她的脸。

　　ASoul

　　创世更新时间：2016-04-2801:26:07字数：262

　　我觉得韩凌枫是有灵魂的，因为他和我很像，我把我的“灵魂”给他了，他就像我跑到那个世界里去了。

　　可我又不是女孩，我怎么让朱梓变成真的？

　　到目前为止，韩凌枫和朱梓只是一个人和一个胡思乱想的角色相遇了，他们一起聊天走路解谜。只是感觉比较好，但他们还没有真正契合，他们还没接纳彼此成为生命中不可割舍的一部分。

　　可你不能让一个人和一个幻想契合吧，朱梓得活起来。

　　话说想到这里我又迷茫了，我所崇拜的大神话都很少，他们是没时间说？还是其实这样不好？

　　这些感悟和目标会不会成为这本书的一部分，以至于使正文不完整了？我想，就算不好，我也得去弄明白原因。

　　一

　　中午了，阳光毫无遮拦地照进了房间，阿龙醒来了。

　　他懒散地去刷牙洗脸，看着那些牙刷和杯子。

　　阿龙叼着烟，在这里过了两年半，他渐渐发现这屋里还有另一个人。

　　是的，你的屋里还有另一个人，尽管你完全不记得他，也不知道他是谁。

　　日子一天天过去，渐渐地你能发现他留下的痕迹，他的性格和小习惯。

　　是的，这屋里还有另一个人。

　　二

　　下午，阿龙会去一家饭馆传菜，那是一家热热闹闹的大餐馆，下午特别忙。

　　上午没什么事，但他觉得无聊，于是就打半天工。

　　厨师长五大三粗的，他总是埋着头不说话，收了工才闲聊几句。

　　附近街道旁馆子特多，压力也挺大。

　　有一天他发现一个女孩，留着马尾辫，在阳光下散发着柔和的光。

　　挺漂亮的，他想着。

　　他发现女孩每天也会走过这条街，他们总是能擦肩而过。

　　她就好像电影里的那样美丽。

　　她身边有一群朋友，都有着相同的气质。

　　阿龙想着我要专一才行。

　　她有时站中间，有时没有，她声音很小，阿龙从来没有听到过她的声音。

　　阿龙烫了头发，发型不好他不敢出门。

　　有时阿龙没遇到她，会在那里抽支烟等一会儿。

　　有时等到她他就现在很远的地方，用余光看着她；有时等不到，他就会觉得失落，然后离开。

　　三

　　在城市的一角生活，喜欢着一个女孩，一切平凡又简单。

　　阿龙从没想过去认识她，他相信自己主动事情就会搞砸。

　　所以从远处看着她，就很好了。

　　有天夜里，他没心情玩游戏，于是抽着烟，逛空间。

　　他看到附近的人里有个不一样的扣扣，也是网络头像，也是挺有个性的昵称，可什么地方不一样。

　　阿龙加了好友，聊了一会儿，对方很有趣。

　　她叫林海清，说话很可爱的样子。

　　他开始翻她的空间，女孩很有文采，好友很多，赞很多。

　　然后他看到了她的照片，姣好的脸颊，瀑布样的长发。

　　竟然是她！

　　竟然是她！

　　阿龙双手颤抖着，翻开之前的对话，她很坦诚，很有兴趣的样子。

　　她喜欢我吗？

　　她喜欢我吗？

　　她有点喜欢我吧？

　　这世上最幸福的事就是你喜欢的人，她也喜欢你。

　　难以言表。

　　四

　　街边餐馆都多少有点黑道色彩，只不过很淡。

　　关于女孩

　　十年了，她穿梭在情场，他来过三次。

　　第一次很简单，他没有看到那些隐藏着的故事。

　　第二次有些麻烦，他什么都不要，这很麻烦。

　　我激怒了他，他满口脏话，被赶走了。

　　第三次…他学会了造炸弹，包括熔炼金属，配置火药。

　　…………

　　还是打110把他带走吧。

　　终

　　双溪镇很美，秋季，一片湖倒映着泛黄的枫树林，醉倒了无数摄影师。

　　不过最近，有游客在林中发现了一具被掩埋的女孩尸体。

　　女孩尸体已经开始腐化，是两天前附近城市失踪的女孩，同一天，一打工男子阿龙失踪，警方初步判定为情杀……

　　有极少数网友发现，凶手是流着泪，哭泣着行凶的。

　　1945年8月6日，广岛，被夷为平地。

　　这是一个像触了电似的，满头白发的德国老头，他刚刚关上电视，关于广岛原子弹爆炸的报道戛然而止了。

　　爱因斯坦家乱得出奇，各种资料衣物到处都是，这个老头看上去很疲惫，慢慢地走到他同样乱糟糟的床铺前，躺下了，他就随手拉来毯子的一角，蜷缩着睡着了。

    一、韩凌枫
　　时值二零一五年九月，极阳。
　　今天的太阳出奇地大，阳台上的一束嫩芽焉巴着，看那有些蜷曲的小叶子，似乎也快要沦为她脚底碎黄中的一员了。
　　韩凌枫的就花盆里生活着各种各样的幼苗，不过一直很努力的南瓜已经死了，土豆没事，苹果的小叶子上有几个洞，不过似乎没有大碍，也不知道怎么回事，反正经常莫名其妙地死了就是了，韩凌枫看到那颗挺立着的小柠檬也快不行了，拿漱口的杯子，在厨房接了一杯水，灌了下去。
　　最近无聊到爆，韩凌枫试着种了一些植物，若是以后找不到工作，不至于饿死。
　　韩凌枫觉得，怎样都好，别跟人打交道，谁知道会发生什么莫名其妙的事。
　　他快读大学了，不是很出名。
　　打开手机漫无目的地翻看，屏幕上端跳出一则新闻来，标题是《2020年光棍危机》。那就像碳酸糖投入了水中，快速地冒出泡泡，然后韩凌枫陷入了巨大的恐慌。
　　不能再这样颓废下去了，是时候做点什么了！
　　二、据守！
　　他很少关心别人住在哪儿，除了顾小曼。
　　他以前帮顾小曼复印过报纸，虽说那次他差点死于车祸，不过也算是印象深刻，别的韩凌枫不太清楚，但他总觉得那次是很奇怪啊，那么突然地让自己送报纸，又不说明来意，不过他倒是很乐意。
　　这些日子，父母每天早出晚归，他没事可做时，就玩游戏、看电影，再到看电视剧，已经无聊透了，生物钟也完全打乱。
　　恍惚地走到街上，韩凌枫想，干脆去书城吧，在那些书海中找一本清淡一点的，若是很快就觉得无聊了，随时也可以回来，再不去街上瞎逛，买只小仓鼠啥的……
　　然后他就路过了那个岔路口，顾小曼家在里边。
　　如今他每次路过这里，都会扭头看看，并伴随着一阵恍惚。
　　这丫头没问题吧？整天神神叨叨的……是当初发生了什么事情吗？否则她会发那种神经？
　　她的妈妈骂了她么？她有什么样的苦衷吗？她其实也对自己的缺点感到无力吗…就像曾经的自己那样，那样的无助。
　　韩凌枫忽然不想去书店了，停在人行道上，不知道怎么办才好。
　　他看到那边路口有个小吃摊，摊主是个瘦削的中年人，有着点点花白的头发。
　　今天，自己就在这里呆吧。
　　三、时光如白马
　　其实自己在那儿白坐着，是很不好意思的，于是韩凌枫从包里摸了几张皱巴巴的零钱，向摊主要了点东西，摊主他丝毫没有不适的意思，于是韩凌枫也能心安理得地呆在那里了。
　　正午的太阳有些小了，看上去光照很适中，韩凌枫塞着耳麦听音乐。
　　自己，做事也不够好啊。
　　如果有成绩比你更好的，能力也比你强的人，有比你帅的，说话也比你动听的人，那为什么不去喜欢那个人呢？如果他很爱你，对你好，你又为何不与他相爱呢？
　　也许，根本的问题还是在自己身上吧，小时候也是这么想的，至少韩凌枫从小到大还没看到过比自己更着急的人……
　　韩凌枫闭上眼睛，习惯地用手和头发遮住半张脸，看上去像是石头做的。
　　时光如白马，一去不复返；时光如白发，噬咬着你的心。
　　四、日落
　　韩凌枫不知道自己能带到多久，电量过低时他关了手机，这是他的一个习惯，这样还有点去打电话救急。
　　期间摊主问他是大学生了吧，韩凌枫说自己高三了。
　　不想说话，不想动，不过肾还是得珍惜的。
　　后来天色渐渐变得有些橘黄，中年人收了摊，很快马路边只剩下个水泥柱，还有那些石椅，整个街道在初生的夕阳里飘晃着。
　　再有一个多小时，天就黑了，韩凌枫是不会在外边呆太久的。
　　还是回去吧，继续过自己的生活。
　　顾小曼从小就学钢琴，这也是她的特长啊，说不定以后她会非常的出名啊，成为像那些明星一样的人，这样韩凌枫每次看到她就回很难受。但是像她那样坏脾气的女孩，也许会很孤单呢，那么自己就去安慰她。
　　韩凌枫想着，表情一片严肃。
　　可就在这时，在那拐角处，有个样子很眼熟的漂亮女孩出现了，韩凌枫皱着眉头，然后差点没被吓死，那是她！
　　顾，小，蔓！
　　她比以前漂亮了很多，很像那些遥远的女神了，穿衣服也很时尚。
　　她打着电话，向马路的那一头走去了。
　　韩凌枫看看自己的衣服，马上把头别了过去，冷汗直冒。
　　又突然出现了，还是逃跑吧，自己已经很累了。
　　可她拿着电话的样子，却又有着一种神秘的力量。
　　五、淬火
　　韩凌枫最后还是没有直接走掉，他跟在后边，想着等到自己准备好了，就突然出现。
　　最后他就看到顾小曼和一个很帅的男生一并走着，吃火锅，逛街。后来天黑了，男孩和女孩挤在人群中买铁板烧，空气里散乱着霓虹灯光，音乐声。
　　在小巷里，雪白的路灯打在漆黑的路面上，在角落里，男孩吻了女孩。
　　韩凌枫就站在阳台外的走廊上，在那盏刺眼的聚光灯后边，没人看得到。
　　韩凌枫看着那两个漂亮的人渐渐地走远了，脸上没有什么表情。
　　半个小时后，韩凌枫回到家，很晚都没有睡着，于是拿起正在充电的手机翻看着。
　　有网友说，虽然现在单身男光棍有三千多万条，不过男子通常都会娶比自己年龄小的女孩的，所以光棍危机不会太糟糕的。

　　公元1520年

　　阳光透过树叶和薄雾被滤成了细碎的点点金光，森林里高得看不清树叶的藤树几乎覆盖了整个天空，植物的气根从树顶垂下来，在水饱和度很高的空气中贪婪地吸收着水分和阳光。令人困惑的是，每一棵树的树干上都生长着密密麻麻的根须，有的细如年轻男人的胡须，越靠下的却像是真正的根系一样粗壮。

　　这里除了高大的树木，地面几乎没有任何植被覆盖，也是只有深黑色的泥土上散落着稀稀松松的几片枯黄的落叶。宽大的船型叶因失水枯黄地蜷缩起来，已经开始腐烂。

　　如果是皇宫里那些皇家药剂师来到这里，一定会很是惊讶，而后是好奇。地面上是如此的干净，以至于只有少量的落叶和青苔，大地就这样毫无保留地暴露在湿润的空气当中。这代表了这个地方营腐生微生物的活性非常之强，几乎是超人的能力，才能在这么短的时间内腐蚀掉落叶。

　　或者说……这里生活着以落叶为食物的草食动物？

　　远处传来清脆的碎裂声，却是一个看起来很老的中年男人渐渐出现了。

　　他端着黑金色罗盘，身着黑色的华丽贵族服饰，这件衣服太过正式，明显不太适合丛林处。虽然衣服的主人已经很小心，但还是弄脏了，那些贵气英气多被禁锢在灰尘之下，看上去有些尴尬、不符场合。

　　他秉承了西班牙人一贯的乐观，虽然衣着略显难堪，但是整个人虎虎生风有精神。

　　叶尖摩擦发出沙沙的响声，这人头也不回，只是大声说：“孩子！别乱吃东西。”

　　“扑通”！一声落在男人身后，重物坠地的闷响传来，周围的树木都在振动。

　　只见一个瘦猴一般的生物扭动着从地上爬了起来，没事似的给男人看它手里的东西。这一幕诡异极了，像是一只强壮的猴子努力挺直腰杆要把它手里的东西凑到那人眼前。

　　原来是一只绿色花纹的蜘蛛，已经被捏得口吐绿水，猴子的脸上咧开了一个绽放的笑容。

　　那分明又是一张人类的脸！

　　“被捏死了。”男人似乎习以为常，粗着嗓子提醒他，比起在船上招呼那些水手时不知温柔到哪里去了。

　　他们整个上午都在赶路，最后来到了一座小山顶，山顶上长满了青草，却再也没有任何树木。

　　猴子还是在他的身后，此刻却丝毫感受不到男人身上的某种庄严的情绪，自顾自地拔着草根。

　　“埃里克森，就是这里了，你可要记好了这个地方。”中年人凝视着四周的森林，在这里似乎有一条林与草的界线。

　　小猴子玩着草根，中年男人沉思着。这阳光太耀眼了，他们的影子像是倒在地上的黑染料，异常地鲜明，带着一种恍惚的不真实感。

　　“你在干神马？”那人比维克多小一些，正在啃一个橘子。
　　维克多看着那如同杂草一般生长的头发，心中有些不快。他从小就很讨厌自己的头发乱乱的，那会给自己带来不少麻烦，比如羞愧感。
　　这个啃橘子的男子非常活跃，连带着笨手笨脚的毛病，常常嚎叫着撞倒同学的东西，这与细心的维克多完全不同。两人的座位隔得远，维克多长得帅，几乎不说闲话，而橘子男常常被女生欺负。
　　他们是初中同学，却都不太理解对方，橘子男的文科奇差，物理却名列前茅，这让成绩均衡靠前的维克多感到很无奈。
　　维克多看着他啃橘子，说：“我没干什么……”
　　只是夏天的太阳很舒服。
　　橘子男瞪着眼神经质地看着他，心里想着你没事儿会傻站着？
　　维克多被那双直愣愣的眼睛盯得心里发毛，转身回了教室。
　　时间又到了中午，橘子男独自在教学楼外闲逛，忽然看到那个安装的高高的摄像头，脑海里忽然浮现出维克多的身影。
　　维克多那一版一眼的样子，还真像那个点着红光的摄像头啊……
　　维克多这么优秀，物理那些简单的问题居然不会耶，真的太奇怪了。橘子男心里一直很疑惑。
　　当他再次回到教室，维克多正有些过意不去，之前在走廊上的对话不太礼貌。
　　维克多很细心，他总会感到愧疚，再默默地改正它。
　　橘子男回来后看到维克多正静静地看着自己，不禁愣住了。
　　他在干什么？为什么这样看着自己？
　　维克多是很优秀的，是那种德智体美劳兼备的五好学生，应该不会做没有意义的事情啊。
　　他在干什么呢？
　　一向积极的橘子男忽然有些沉默。
　　维克多该不会趁着停电的夜里，悄悄剪开了摄像头的线路，从而可以得到里面的图像吧？
　　维克多常常抚摸着桌子，衣服，独自发呆，他该不会是拆了投影仪和无线电接收器，悄悄地集成到了衣服，甚至是座椅上了吧，橘子男可毫不怀疑他的能力。
　　1.1
　　阳光透过树枝，寝室里安静得像是停滞了。同学们都在抽时间学习，只有橘子男趴在上铺，想着电路的问题。
　　橘子男是个奇葩，他现在高一，对电路非常感兴趣，在这世上奇葩的热情超越一切，特别是那种很聪明的奇葩。
　　机械太过严谨，只有在思考电路的时候，他才觉得自己像是能守住一切。
　　今天他又遇到一个问题，那些问题总是像天险一般难以逾越。
　　这时候他就会吃点东西，到处发神经。
　　寝室的同学已经不鸟他了，他下了床，拿起一个橘子，猫手猫脚走到门口，把头伸出去瞧了瞧。
　　走廊里一个人都没有，橘子男悄悄来到了隔壁寝室。
　　维克多正在桌前奋笔疾书，对橘子男来说已经达到极限的作业量，维克多却一直文理双修，甚至还念了四书五经。
　　橘子男剥开手中的橘子，绕有兴致地看着眼前的干净男孩。
　　维克多的书桌上什么都没放，只有一盆清新的薄荷，在那简洁时尚的瓶子里，放在桌子左上角的黄金分割点上。
　　初中时维克多的书桌还循规蹈矩地整齐摆放着放着许多书，高中时就不是了，他把古典文学和自然科学丢到了书柜里，只留下了一种空灵的美感。
　　维克多看了一眼橘子男，继续干自己的事。
　　“你发神经啊？”
　　“维克多你才发神经啊，你女鬼上身啊？”
　　橘子男心中不爽，想着等我用放大镜做出苹果一号机了再嘲笑你云云。
　　1.2
　　“橘子男在一坨泥巴上刻了个RB国旗也……”
　　“告诉过你了，劳资在做电动机换向器……”
　　1.3
　　“你这是？”长发女生问。
　　“有一天我要开自己的直升机，已经快成功了……”橘子男说，手都在抖。
　　“嗯……那你加油哦……”
　　1.4
　　不要充电用手机。
　　不要充电用手机。
　　不要充电用手机。
　　吓死人了。
　　重要的事情说三遍。
　　不要充电用手机。
　　不要充电用手机。
　　不要充电用手机。
　　维克多思量片刻，在空间里写下这些，希望每个人都能看到，特别是青洒。
　　然后又觉得太吓人了，皱着眉头考虑了一个多小时，犹豫着删掉了它。
　　然后又觉得不得不发，这个东西要是有人还不知道那才是反人类。
　　就在这时，手机上弹出一条消息，青洒刚刚阅读了被删掉的消息。
　　现在已经凌晨了，她还没睡，他们同时登了扣扣，认真地看同一条消息。
　　世事真是奇怪。
　　2.0.1
　　他是法国留学回来的，只差一点点，他就能成为一个著名的生物化学家了。
　　除了化学，他就什么都没有了，他也睡着军绿色的铁架床，枕着干净但色彩不协调的粗布被子。
　　可他的知识能推动整个人类的进步。
　　青平安，他来到这世界是带着某种使命的。
　　2.0.2
　　红唇，苗条的身材，大多时候很安静。她低调，又带着不可抗拒的魔力。
　　她被称为“红桃”，这意味着别人无法完成的事她就可以做到。
　　那是在一个酒吧，舞台前摇晃着缭乱的霓虹灯，他看到一个戴着眼镜的男人。
　　他就像一点快要熄灭的蜡烛，看上去很老，老得快死了。
　　她忽然就走到台前，亲手调了两杯酒，走了过去。
　　开玩笑，她是这里的老板娘。
　　2.0.3
　　她怀了他的孩子。
　　他要求打掉，他不要后代，可她坚持留下孩子。
　　他竟然暴怒了，她失手杀掉了他。
　　她是这里的地头蛇，他只是个异乡人，这事没能惊动派出所。
　　有天夜里，她生下了个女孩，取名叫青洒。
　　3.0
　　“我们的教室在五楼，宿舍在三楼。”维克多看着青洒。
　　“一个人的体重，乘以三楼，足以摧毁人身上任何一块软骨。”
　　“可从来没人注意到。”
　　3.1
　　“如果我们都喜欢同一个女孩怎么办呢？”
　　“那你是王子，我是骑士，人再多点就是骑士团。”
　　“说不定能征服亚欧板块。”
　　3.2
　　这么多年了，还是只能看着她乘车走远。
　　除非你立下生命的誓言。
　　保护她，无论是战火，白骨。
　　一瞬间只觉这世上空无一人，英雄们都死了，他们的后代还在红旗下成长着。
　　3.3
　　此为永别。
　　我以为已经足够清静。
　　最后我还是哭了
　　忽然间，泪如雨下，一塌糊涂。
　　 3.4
　　人一生总是要遇到好多好多的人
　　遇到对的人，人们就相爱，
　　遇到错的人，人们就离开。
　　他们说你会找到你真正爱的人
　　可若是你在身边
　　你就是我最爱的人
　　3.5
　　她好像又不走了，也没有说一句话。
　　煎熬。
　　3.6
　　你的背篼我挑
　　你的网费我烧
　　你的丫头我教
　　3.7
　　…………
　　“你根本不懂！”女子说。
　　“事实上，我懂，我从小体弱多病，扎针几十次，手术应该也有十回，有两回无麻醉，那时我还小，有几回是在精神病院里全麻电疗，病人们前一天都被关在禁闭室里禁水，否则可能就会死人。当时我觉得我可能一生都要呆在那里了。”
　　“我醒来时，连我自己是谁都记不得，而我根本没病，因为我自己就是精神病医生。”
　　“我学法语是因为青洒，我学日语是因为觉得他们人很好，而我学临床是因为我绝不会再去医院看病，我受伤了我就自己给自己动手术。”维克多平静地说。
　　4.0
　　“如果我是个男孩，即使只有一天。
　　清晨我会，从床上跳下来。
　　我望着天空，去酒吧勾搭女生。
　　我兄弟都挺我。”
　　“？？……”

/fst/sky/moon-river/Zero. About/Mr.Cao.txt



　　一

　　公元二零一三年五月三日，凌晨，大概是夜猫子刚刚准备去睡觉的时候。

　　曹家大院。

　　这是一间又宽又干净的大房子，大得仿佛是另一番天地了。所有的东西都在发光，花纹大气考究的砖地板、几十上百年的什么木的家具，来自欧洲的某种珍惜动物皮革所制的沙发，世界上的每一款这种皮沙发都是身价上亿美元的大师手工制作的，他们的外形都是独一无二的。

　　这座房子配备有同样豪华的厨房、卫生间、阳台、花园、泳池…这处住所本身就是一件艺术品，是可以整个搬到展览厅里去供人膜拜的那种，日常维护就需要至少是艺术系研究生才能涉足，否则任何一个行动都是在破环她的美感。

　　一代又一代的艺术家把这座房子都看成是自己的孩子，对她倾注了毕生的心血，一位又一位颇有灵气的年轻艺术家在这里老去，变成了白白发苍苍的老人，无数英才的灵魂都安居在这里了，这座建筑也就成了无价之宝，渐渐地有了自己的灵魂。

　　此时天边的鱼肚白还都淹没在黑暗中，在顶楼庭宅里，曹廷安终于做出了决定，然后他点亮那盏皇家水晶吊灯，把原本透过巨大水族缸的幽蓝色睡眠呼吸灯的光芒遮盖了。

　　他拿起放在那水晶床头柜上定制的黑色镶钻手机，看着幻蓝色鱼缸里游动的热带鱼，拨通了海拉的号码。

　　曹廷安的父亲去世之后，他就担起了还要照顾妈妈的责任，提前踏入那个由父亲一手建起的庞大、陌生又复杂的金钱帝国里，唯一的依靠就只有海拉了。

　　海拉比曹廷安大六岁，金发，家乡是欧洲东部某个名不见经传小国家，十一岁时来到中国，十七岁时就已经成为了曹峰钢铁集团这只工业巨兽总裁的私人助理，几乎每个认识海拉的人都疑惑于她何以能在这般年纪就能有此作为，后来他们才知道，海拉是一个当之无愧的天才，她的计算能力和协调能力可以说是无人能及。

　　“海拉是那个公司人脉的全能型服务端。”竞争对手们在开会时这样描述她，就是指她对各种事情各个员工的强大协调能力。

　　有无数的人想要挖走海拉，因为这个人的潜力实在是太可怕了。但是海拉对无论多高的条件都无动于衷，又过了十年，曹峰钢铁集团总裁的独子曹廷安已经长成大孩子了，海拉依然还在那个位子上，且散发着女王般的气场。

　　但是只有少数人知道，海拉是曹峰钢铁集团总裁收养的孩子，她的双亲死于非命，正在街头等死时偶遇了曹廷安的爸爸，这才被他带了回去，并被他培养成了自己未来继任者的得力助手。

　　海拉是不可能背叛曹家的，海拉是不会背叛曹家的，即使是没人理解，即使是举目无亲。

　　即使是后来曹廷安的父亲因突发疾病英年早逝……吗？

　　但是这真相对曹廷安来说并不重要，海拉是像他姐姐那样的人，是他即将就任的那家公司里最熟悉的人，又是那么的有能力，若是因为怀疑就转而问别人，那除非是曹廷安放弃了这间父亲留给自己的这家公司。

　　而曹廷安是不会放弃的，除非是揭开父亲的死所留下的疑团。

　　“呵呵，老板好啊。没想到您这么早就醒了。”冰凉的手机响了一会后被接通了，电话那头传来了慵懒的女声，海拉倒是像往常一样开着玩笑。

　　“我还是喜欢你叫我廷安啊海拉姐……”曹廷安听到海拉的声音心里很舒服，像是一直压在他胸口的时候被撤走了一样，但是毕竟是自己这么晚了还把人家吵醒，他心里挺不好意思的。

　　“嗯好吧，廷安。怎么了？”海拉没有怪曹廷安，因为他从小就担心这担心那，如今也是为人谨慎，即使年纪轻轻却比同龄人要靠谱得多。

　　“我知道已经很晚了，我很抱歉，不过我一夜没睡，嘿嘿，我要去突袭杰克叔叔！”

　　杰克是又一位曹峰钢铁集团中的外籍高层，是个美国中年人，有着刮得干净利落的络腮胡子，衬上黑色的西装简直是帅极了。杰克也是曹峰钢铁集团资格最老的高层，据说他与曹廷安的爸爸有着很深的交情，曹廷安想了一晚上，决定还是去问他一些事情。

　　“知道了知道了，多打听些秘密哦廷安，老家伙可是知道很多秘密的！”

　　打完电话海拉躺在床上又纠结了起来，这样下去公司里的局面不知道会不会有所改变啊，还有，她怎么能让曹廷安那个小孩子去一个老狐狸那儿打听消息呢？

　　海拉拧开了床头灯，橘黄色的温和的光芒把她那条白色睡裙衬托得很柔美。

　　曹廷安开着银白色的兰博基尼在高速路上静静地滑行，车窗外的夜色开始有一丝泛白。他十八岁生日那天拿到了机动车驾驶证，但是他也如同所有的年轻人一样喜欢开快车。

　　曹延安调整好状态，把手机调成静音，用座位旁的按钮加速到了每小时两百公里，整辆车像是一道夜幕下的银色疾影。

　　杰克现在应该，在乡下吧？曹延安的脸上带着微笑。

　　二

　　2013年5月3日6:00am

　　黎明缓缓地到来了，天空像是浑浊的湖水在渐渐泛白，曹廷安站在田野中一座两层的阁楼下，缓缓地呼吸，从嘴里吐出一丝淡淡的烟雾。

　　他熬了一晚上，现在虽然脑子很清醒，反应却很慢，若是不干些什么提提神曹廷安觉得自己会发生些什么意料之外的事情。

　　这里只是普通的农田，公路边一座略显粗糙的三层小洋楼单薄地矗立着，楼边还有一辆沾满灰尘的红色拖拉机。

　　曹廷安的跑车在这里出现真的是太过惹眼了。这么看上去的话，杰克似乎是一个辛勤的劳动人民，在大好的时代下靠自己的勤劳致富。

　　但是杰克是个猥琐的老外啊，这违和感几乎都要爆表！

　　曹廷安把烟头掷在地上，用帆布鞋踏熄了，从墙里传来一阵恶毒的狗吠。院子的白铁皮大门没关，从门缝里隐约可以看到一条大号的黄黑的狗正恶毒地吠着。

　　就是这里么？

　　曹廷安用半小时的时间飚了一百多公里，自从进入了这个小镇他就被各种脱线情绪所占据，每一堵墙、路边那些手掌高的水稻、每一条狗都在刺激着他的心理承受能力，话说自己是不是被那老头子给耍了，要是被当成小偷包围了该怎么办啊。

　　小心地走进院子，那条大黄狗不停地狂吠着，一次又一次地冲击着那条两指粗的铁链。

　　这货该不会从小就把那链子扯到大的吧，曹廷安这样想。

　　狗窝的对面有座鸡棚，老母鸡们把头伸了出来，深沉地凝视着曹廷安。

　　曹廷安站着想了一会儿，然后蹑手蹑脚地进了那门，狗吠得更厉害了。曹廷安开始想那狗最怕什么，当然是它的主人打它所用的棍子。虽然整个院子看上去不是那种特别严谨的摆设，不过不可能每次狗乱咬人都去专门找那棍子，所以棍子很可能是在这附近的。

　　曹廷安环视四周，很幸运的，在别人家大门口有一根鸡毛掸子，于是曹廷安走过去拿起掸子对着那大黄狗挥舞了几下，那狗果然就不吭声了。

　　这狗在看门的狗中算是很大的，曹廷安看着那似乎有着藏獒血统的庞大身躯，无语于此刻它眼里流露出的惊慌。

　　看来狗的主人很爱狗啊，说不定平常还会不忍把狗栓起来。

　　曹廷安看那狗渐渐安静下来了，走到院子的门口，犹豫了一下，然后敲了敲门。过了一会儿，门里一点声音都没有，这时他突然觉得自己很傻，刚刚狗叫得那么大声都没人听到，这会儿他这么敲门人会有人听到？

　　但是大门明明是开着的，房子里没人的可能性不大，用科研部那帮人的话来说就是陷入了逻辑死角，曹廷安环视院子，整个院子很正常，狗也很正常，发生什么事的可能性不大。

　　这段时间是曹廷安人生的重要过渡，是决不能出一点差错的，可是万一发生什么事就不好了，曹廷安想了一会儿，最终还是使劲敲了敲门。

　　然后曹廷安就在那门前敲了十多分钟，都快要放弃了。

　　忽然听到门里有脚步声，有人走过来，打开了门，一个头发花白却很精神的的老头子出现在曹廷安眼前，那人皮肤上有些斑点，穿着一件有些脏的大衣一般的外套，淡然地看着曹廷安。

　　“哟，稀客啊。”果然是杰克，还操着一口很纯正的中文。

　　泥煤……你这样子能听见人家敲门么，曹廷安想。

　　杰克的乡间小屋从外表上看和附近其他的房子没什么不同，不过走进了房间才可以看到，这里的摆设很简洁，色调很和谐。进门后可以看到客厅很干净，地板、桌子椅子都比较偏木色，杰克是比较会享受生活的老头，虽然有些人也说他比较慵懒。

　　杰克的话很少，给人的感觉是很厚重，曹廷安觉得那种父亲的味道又回来了。

　　老头带着年轻人走进客厅，曹廷安撇见那浅木色的椅子上坐着一位正在看新闻的少年，穿着纯黑色的体恤。背对着他们，头发很直很干净，是个亚洲人。

　　“介绍一下，他叫建军，是我的小侄子。”这屋子里很保暖，杰克真帮曹廷安把外衣挂在椅子上。

　　曹廷安本想自己来，一听这话愣住了，想着你什么时候有个中国侄子了，还面不改色，用父亲的话说，就是“老狐狸尾巴露出来了吧”。

　　当他看到那少年转过头来时，一瞬间有些失神，那个孩子的长相其实并不出众，皮肤很黑，人很小，却长着一张成年人的脸，眼睛又黑又空，波澜不惊。

　　那种眼神曹廷安还是第一次看到，很凝实，很平淡，像是一块没有思想的石头。这种人曹廷安还是第一次见到，不过也很合逻辑，毕竟奇葩的人总有神奇的朋友，杰克就是这种奇葩的人，这很正常。

　　男孩很沉默，可是那种感觉让人觉得很礼貌，就像是他已经打过了招呼。

　　“建军，这位是曹廷安，他是我的老板。”杰克说。

　　“你好。”建军说，声调没有变化，不过从说话的节奏上还是能看出惊讶。

　　曹廷安意识到眼前这位少年可能只比自己小了一点，于是说：“很优秀啊！”

　　然后曹廷安想起来自己是来突袭杰克的，于是笑嘻嘻地说，我又发现你的小秘密了哦，杰克老狐狸！

　　杰克笑了笑，为曹廷安倒了水，坐下来聊天，为曹廷安讲了关于他父亲的往事。

　　取暖所用的火盆很温暖，也温暖了曹廷安的心。曹廷安的心以前是凉的，凉到一定程度了他就会去飙车，刺激一下他那颗麻木的心。如今这种温暖的感觉已经很少了，这世上只有杰克和海拉能给他亲人般的温暖了，他很珍惜。

　　杰克喝着茶，为曹廷安讲了他爸爸在年轻时候的事，时间已经不早，曹廷安看了看表，已经快要八点了，于是起身穿上外衣。

　　“九点我就要开会去了，这是我人生第一次主持会议，你居然请假！”曹廷安背对着杰克，说。

　　“我也是没办法嘛，不过我相信这难不倒你的，你可是曹家的长子。”杰克喝着茶，“这么说起来你这么喜欢飙车，慢点才好嘛。”

　　“安啦，我的物理课可是从没有被扣过分！”曹廷安深呼吸，已经开始调整状态，开快车这种事马虎不得。

　　“那我就不送你了。”曹廷安转身前，看到杰克的茶杯上冒着蒸腾的白气。

　　跑车发动的声音传来，屋子里又安静了下来，只有液晶电视的屏幕变换着各种色彩，声音早已没有开。

　　杰克喝了口茶，把头靠在座椅上闭目养神。

　　“他怎么样？”建军一边说，一边玩着自己修长的手指。

　　这个少年从刚才开始就一直没说话，似乎是有些怕生的样子。

　　“曹廷安啊，年轻的曹氏钢铁集团董事长，肩负了很多的责任。”杰克说。

　　“我很喜欢他，我会去他的公司的。”

　　“其实到现在我都不太能肯定你的身份。却还是不得不去做事，”杰克打量着眼前这个少年，觉得那身黑衣更显神秘了。

　　“还真的觉得我老了。”

　　“说起来，我也有一个朋友……也很无助。”

　　而在不远处的高速公路上，风在吹打着浅浅的车窗，天都亮了，白色的光很冷，驾驶座上的曹廷安觉得，这世上有太多的事，自己无能为力。

　　不过，还是要全力以赴地走下去。

    关于上界，古籍中鲜有记载，只是说，明亮如白昼，极北有雪域，极南有深山。

　　修炼之道，也颇有异同。很多仙家大术，在这里可能只是基础。
　　他深吸一口气，环顾四周。
　　气息异常浓郁，可能是人力而为。
　　他并非强行破界，意味着能够理解上界真气而内化，在此自由活动。
　　上界小，下界大，而下界底蕴已颇为深厚，却极少有人飞升，就是因为下界气息混杂，人口众多。
　　气息混杂，则以淬炼肉体为易；人口众多，则相互影响，真气乱流，难以参透天地奥妙。
　　上界小，下界大，孕育了无穷的炼体之人，所以下界才与上界并称为两界。
　　可是炼体者无法抵御上界气息的剥夺，极难飞升。若是强行破界，即便没有失去形体，也会意识破碎，半人半鬼。
　　自始至终，能够以肉体强行飞升的，也就只有盘古一人。

　　后来他就常常向往于此，也仅仅只是向往。
　　顾小蔓是写小说的，写得烂的一皮，还拉韩凌枫一起写。

　　女孩还是挺自负自己有两下子，可这种事，从来都是男生的阿。

    他忽然发现，她一直在身后看着他，站在那里已经很久了。
　　“天凉了，你会感冒的。”姑娘小声地说，她手里捧着叠好的细布衣服，洗得很干净。
　　她帮他披上衣服，仍是呆站了很久，欲言又止。
　　“哥，有时候我觉得……若我也是一个男子，该多好。”
　　“那样我或许就可以成为你的好友，陪你一起谈笑、喝酒、打猎……”

/fst/sky/moon-river/Backup/The Plan.txt




　　 15、5、30：基本上确定了小说展开情节的思路，首先描写一个现实的世界，然后在人物的探索、行动下挖掘出潜在的东西。
　　以快读、慢读都适宜为目标，力求“看到文字就想到画面”的描写，“细细读来颇有感悟”的抒情。
　　人物塑造方法为：现实主义。来源于生活，力求准确地把一个人物的一生展现出来(这样好么)
　　before————————————
　　写大纲之前首先写一下我现在的想法。第一，为什么叫大纲而不是总纲，我也不知道，但是没有人管它叫总纲的！总纲是类似于“天地会总纲”那样的东西吧--，所以还是叫它大纲算了，字面上的意思是“大体剧情”什么的，不过我的大纲有点特殊，剧情角色感情一起写，大概就是这样吧。
　　首先是第一卷，名字叫靖难，这是跟历史上明朝发生的靖难之役有关，或者说以它为基础、前提什么的而改编的情节。（“靖难之役”见相关资料），靖难之役发生的事件经过改编之后引出了一个神秘的空间。
　　世界概念
　　“空间”是指它像是地球附近凭空多出来的一块，在地球附近，空间凹陷形成了一个独立地带，与外界只有一个拳头大小的连接点，这个连接点从三维空间上看是一块有着一定质量的小圆球(?!)，所有与它相接触的物体、能量都会被吸入，受重力的影响。为质量大小始终在变化，它在地球表面做无规则环绕运动，有时上万年远离地球，有时坠入太平洋吞噬海水……有时数万年长夜，有时数万年烈日炎炎。而在人类文明崛起的数千年里，它从太空回归，进入比较稳定的环绕，周期大约是数十年到数千年接近一次地球，造成过大规模的灾难。
　　它的一个定义是它与外界只有一个出入口，光也是从这里进入的，看起来就像太阳一样，但是不太温暖；唯一的出口也是这里，但是距离异空间中的地面太远（几千米至几万米始终在移动），所以从它诞生起进入的人和东西就没有出来过。历史上没有任何关于这里的记载，它造成的空间缺失放到太阳系，乃至整个宇宙中都是微不足道的，所以人类社会至今不知道这里的存在。
　　***补充1时间规则：由于一些原因（。。引力异常什么的），进入这个空间时时间的速度受到影响，内部时间流逝速度不平均。
　　第二个定义是空间中有不太稳定的生态系统，绝大多数是植物且热带植物居多（经常落入地球中吸水，水分多），当它在太阳直射下的热季气候温暖，植物茂盛持续生长；在太阳光被遮挡的寒季会造成缓慢的植物大批死亡（植物因寒冷死亡，微生物将其分解后放出热量）还是能保持温度。有少量昆虫和大量微生物。
　　进入热量难以散出，由于入口小它在远古时可能较为寒冷，但是经过亿万年的堆积已经比较温暖，这些热量被转化为化学能储存在植物体内。所以这里的气候自从稳定下来便逐渐有植物出现并形成了稳定的生态系统。
　　季候分两季，时间不定短则数十年长则数百年，昼夜长短不定但是周期不短，一个白昼最少也是地球上的数天。（有时它绕地球的速度很快）
　　白昼很长，黑夜也很长，所以这里的植物能储存更多的糖分，甚至还在某些方面表现出动物一样的特征。
　　（植物细胞储存糖类的细胞器是液泡，储存糖分的器官是果实、某些根茎。所以这里的植物根系发达，组织颜色浅而且随着白天的变长其颜色会越来越浅，体内甚至会有大量液体流动）
　　******************坑：这个空间的重力为什么会和地球上差不多，这个问题难以解答，只能说它的泥土厚度大得难以想象。（于是这样一来可能就会多了很多神奇的生物，大地龙什么的）
　　第三个定义是历史上进入过的人。从人类进入农耕社会开始，大约每隔数百年就会有人被送入，但是相当分散没有规律，而且进入的人再不会出来，所以人类社会一直都没有发现异常空间的存在，只是很多人把很多由它影响的现象错误地归为不同的原因引起的，因为在没有证据的情况下，没有人可以知道是否有什么东西存在。
　　在设定中，进入这个空间的人不少，各个地区的人，各个时代的人，有小人物，也有对世界走向产生重大影响的大人物。这么多人进入了这个空间，并且不同程度地重建了自己所在地区的文明，导致在几十公里的异常空间里曾经诞生过十数个成一定规模的文明和无数的部落、小型团体。
　　***第零定义
　　这个空间很安全么？如果是，那么这么多的人在这个空间里像在地球上一样生活、繁衍，也绝对发现了它的秘密，从而想办法出去了。但事实上并没有任何人出去过这里，这些璀璨的，文化融合而产生的绚烂多姿的文明，都莫名地被切断了，几乎一点东西也没有留下，亘古不变的只是树林——不会说话的树、树、树！正是这个世界每隔一段时间便会大灭绝一次，而每一次，都是相当暴力的灭绝：泥土被掀开、山脉被破坏、板块被打碎（如果有板块的话）、动植物被吞噬，只有微生物和土壤中难以发现的种子能够存活。造成这一切的原因是一个谜一般的生物。
　　所有会动的东西遇到它都会被毁灭，所以只有异常空间部落中的酋长、祭司一类的人从极为罕见的古遗迹里可怖的伤痕中得知了它的存在，并且将其封存。（异常空间的有些文明时期存在极少数的遗迹，它们被传送入的人发现后细心地保护起来，而大多数文明则是被毁灭得渣都不剩）
　　在有一个文明时期，穿越的秘密便是被聚集起来的穿越者隐瞒了，只留下一些遗迹手稿之类，新任酋长祭司参观遗迹后便能推理出事情的大概，就这样经过了无数代人平安无事，于是这个穿越与毁灭的故事成了当地口口相传的故事，虽然有大部分人不太相信，但还是有狂热的支持者。部落中颇有心计的人察觉到他们在害怕什么，却死活问不出来。但是有一天，在这一代的新酋长还未曾忘记古老的恐怖时，他被人从睡梦中偷听到了这个故事，于是造成了大规模的骚乱和恐怖，起义军以此为借口准备推翻古老的君主，并且还做了像模像样的应对远古魔神的措施。
　　但是当起义军与部落军在马里奥堡最终决战之时，远古魔神苏醒了，它力大无穷，恍若开天的神祗，巨大的伟力撕裂了天空、大地和海洋。但是历史上唯有这一次人类是做了充分的准备工作的，至少留下了较多的遗迹；这段历史被随后出现的更加先进的文明解读了出来，魔神的传说被揭开，但还是被政治高层所知晓，他们肩负起了拯救世界的责任。
　　（PS。1*因为进入的人一次比一次来自更加先进文明的时代，而且这些文明领袖有意识地寻找十数年乃至百年才出现一次的来自原先世界的穿越者，而且没有天敌的制约，所以与人口数量相比，这里的文明科技水平发展速度极快，就算是被毁灭一次比一次更加先进，发展速度更快。）
　　（这样充满暴力的古神话影响着这里一代又一代的人，他们崇尚力量，坚信“武道”云云）
　　*高潮剧情开始之前发生的事是在一个伪现实世界里的，它与真实的现实世界几乎没有差别，只是多出了一群秘密一点的人，所以伪现实世界只是比真正的这个世界有一点点的不同。在那个世界里，社会环境除了平和之外，还有一点点神秘感，以及对知识的看重和尊重，在这样的环境下熏陶出来的少年会去做一些神秘又正值伟大的事，即使他们心中的正义不被承认。
　　洛克组织称这里为红月，因为在它刚刚受到太阳照射时，由于是球形，光的折射率一开始很大，故清晨天空为血红色而得名。UFO称这里为广寒，取自神话，有人为进入的意图。
　　其实这个东西是一节损坏的外星飞船推进器，核动力推进，以空间曲率为约束力，以稳定核聚变代替火箭燃料的化学反应，速度快得难以想象，不过还不能突破光速，是常规火箭与正反粒子湮灭引擎、曲率引擎之间的过渡产品。
　　其中有一生命，职能是控制反应，以核聚变为生命活动的能量来源，最开始的光球已经死了，它在吸收了地球土壤后为适应环境变成了岩石、昆虫、哺乳动物的外型。
　　亚历克斯是它的弟弟，是类似于备胎的存在，当
　　*************************剧情、人设
　　第一卷的主要讲的是主人公韩凌枫怎样从一个普通人阴差阳错地加入一个未知的团队的，这本书是穿越，主人公肯定是要穿越的，这是穿越之前的磨合吧。首先韩凌枫是一个各方面一般般的学生，性格上比较温和，不会到处惹麻烦的那种人，责任心偏强，很善良，总是在想自己哪里哪里又做错了什么的，其实这样的人学习不好是因为他没有动力和决心吧，总之，实际上韩凌枫在班里算是一个比较胆怯、自由自在的心地善良之人，死对头什么的几乎没有。这样来看，他已经在心底承认了自己“平平常常”，他没有信心，觉得自己天生就不是那种某方面很强的人。
　　女生缘他方面一般般偏好，女生觉得他这样的人很好，他唯一的惹人讨厌的地方就是女生缘比较好，班上的女生都不反感和他说话啦讨论啦，这是韩凌枫唯一惹人记恨的地方，如果他处理好了这个问题那么韩凌枫几乎就是亲切榜头号王老五。但是韩凌枫从来没有想过这样的事情，所以啦，他还是自由自在地生活着，成绩也稳步上升。
　　韩凌枫在主要剧情开始后的半年以前被一个向他表白的女生给大骂了，正常情况下，这样的阴影会持续笼罩他几年的时间，他唯一的惹人喜欢的地方，亲切也将被无情地割去。所以不得不让人怀疑他是否是一场阴谋的受害者，但是无论如何，韩凌枫彻底丧失了他原来所有的一些正常人的品格和行为，让人感觉到他在发疯。（隐藏事件）
　　第一部是讲韩凌枫如何从一个青春期刚过的正常无比的人变成了别人眼中的天才级人物，总是是要起到一定的励志才好。韩凌枫遭遇了神秘队伍后与这些爱思考的天才级人物经历了一场冒险，最终也有了自己的执著和追求。
　　*神秘队伍总体人设
　　男性角色是一名神秘强大的队长，死板强大的副队长，一个爱吃橘子的落魄机械师程序猿：橘子男，崇拜肌肉精通各种武器的霸哥，年龄最老的大叔厨子和一力大无穷的兽人）没错，兽人！锲子过后会有他与古代玄幻的碰撞，说是一本以面对玄幻的小说也不为过吧！）；女角色是擅长枪械物理的短发活力女，擅长数学算法的眼镜短发女邓秋离，擅长生物化学的长发女。
　　主人公是傻子男（应该是中二男才对），所以主要人物的性格习惯都是别人自己拿出来分享的。
　　****邓秋离
　　邓秋离就是那种所谓的班级里人人皆知的好学生，从小如此。她的人生头十八年没有瑕疵，而且带着今后也不会有的趋势。她是韩凌枫的小学同学，初、高中校友（初高中韩凌枫已经被分班制与女神隔离开了），但是她的身世、家庭没有人知道，韩凌枫被强迫加入神秘队伍第一次任务后发现邓秋离就是这里的资深队员，主攻算法，这一切似乎证明着，女神不是人而是神，与韩凌枫这种狗腿子是完全不同的两种生物！！
　　能不说话就不说话。
　　****维克多
　　神秘队伍副队长。性格强迫、完美主义者，最突出的习惯是用无死角摄像头观察自己的每一个动作表情。维克多会把每天所有见过的人、自己与他人发生的对话等记录在脑海里，以便进行逻辑思考，因为好奇，他喜欢探究别人在想什么。
　　总是想得很周到，长得很帅。
　　****青洒
　　化学家的女儿，有机化学与生物化学爱好者。很漂亮，总能成功。名字是自己改的，对大多数人没有安全感，却与维克多默契无间。

　　计时狂，总是在计算时间。
　　此人极度佩服队长。
　　***霸哥
　　军事爱好者，在勤奋方面他是一个天才，并且尽可能地把自己往特种兵的方向锻炼；爱好跑酷，经常受伤，所以也学了基本的急救、医学，但是大伤都是维克多处理的，所以很是佩服维克多。
　　***兽人默德
　　在第一部中加入队伍，与异常空间中灭世的巨人是近亲，性格是老实憨厚崇尚力量什么的。
　　总人设中配角、隐藏人物顾小曼。
　　＊反派角色
　　海拉：美国人，某秘密集团富二代的继任之后的直接下属，女强人，智商超高，算法大师。她是这个神秘的集团前任老总留给继承人的唯一一位心腹级助理，牛叉到爆，全能。这个集团的继承人发现了公司中的秘密，以及被人追杀，海拉是他活下来的唯一依靠。

　　当穿越之后维克多等人凭借知识和力量稳定并且掌控了局面，而队长李巫和理科奇才橘子男联手竟然硬生生将这个时代的科技水平往前猛地拉近了一千多年，而时空旅行依然遥遥无期。就在一个冬天，每个人都已经绝望的时候，异变出现了，这个世界有古怪！踏海仙人、异兽屠城！而韩凌枫则被仙人认定其有“仙缘”，被仙人收为徒弟！韩凌枫带着古刀江月去往了武夷之山，开始逐步学习修真。
　　精彩之处在于：这个世界上真的有所谓“修仙”、“仙人”吗？韩凌枫究竟会经历什么？这一行人将何去何从？
　　dream

　　也许你最在意的人，都会变成你最爱的人
　　可你最爱的人，不是你的爱人
　　一棵树一生会发几次芽
　　一场雨一晚会说几句话

　　可一颗心满满的，如何携手再走

　　建军说：“你看看这些人，他们看到了人性的弱点，却不想去改变，只是从中捞取利益，无论是物质的还是非物质的。”
　　“曾经有一个开朗的孩子，天天在深夜玩手机，如此的孤单。”
　　“几年前的你自己，正在你心中，哭泣着。”
　　“不是么？”
　　他的声音越来越清晰，通过人工肺所挤出的空气发出沉重嘈杂的声音，仿佛能看见那黑色的怒火不可遏制地迸发出来。
　　韩凌枫原本那些着急和激动的情绪竟然都凭空消失了，鸡皮疙瘩很快地起了全身。韩凌枫觉得孤独和惊慌，这样的时刻，自己却仿佛感觉不到那些刀尖和火焰划在自己的身上一样。没有同感，难道自己的人性已经在几年的孤独中被泯灭了吗？
　　韩凌枫被自己惊出了一身冷汗，随后又摇摇头让自己恢复理智。
　　建军一直都是一个稳重的人，他从来不多说一个字，从来不多发出一个声音，这样一直有四年这么久。而今天他是如此歇斯底里，如此疯狂。
　　他已经豁出去了，今天，将是生死之战！
　　——————————————————————————————————————
　　“别跟我说这些，这算什么？这不过是因为自利说出的一句话罢了，你想想你自己做了什么，你杀死了一个女孩，还把一个男孩逼到了绝境。
　　他一直重复着知错了，磕着头，有些人似乎已经认为他是在刺激男孩，让他发奋。
　　他表现得有些英勇，难不成真是豁出性命的刺激吗？
　　难道他真是在刺激男孩让他发奋？
　　我几乎已经这样认为了，可我忽然想起来，有那么多的办法可以让男孩变好，可他偏偏就是要让女孩子去死。
　　可这时我竟然完全想不到办法。
　　我放他走了，很多年后我忽然想起来，男孩女孩什么都可以不要，以至于拖累了别人，是因为，他们已经什么都不剩了啊。
　　他们已经不再奢望任何，稍微好一点的生活。

　　这是一家郊外的酒家，之前这里是没有人烟的，直到最近才因为枫华酒舍而有了慕名而来的人，渐渐地出现了小镇。
　　据说这里隐居着一位高人，原本位居朝廷大博士，同时又是传说中凌虚位仙人的在世。是这世间唯一一位精通科学，而又遗世独立的仙人。有人说，他就是当朝五大圣人中最神秘的那一个，也就是韩凌枫。
　　甚至还有人说，这间酒家的掌柜就是枫的好朋友。

　　河与岸之间是没有界限的，全被雾气淹着，白气在这一片天地里浮游着，一直延伸漫天的星海之中。到我们都怔住了，我们从未想过会看到这般奇景，这简直是美得不像话。
　　然而我们就看到在那雾中安静地坐着一个小男孩，自然健康的黑发，虽是月景，却似乎满脸都是阳光。
　　我看着怪熟悉的，仔细一想才发现那竟是十八岁的自己。

    维克多的胡子已经留到一寸长，他看上去有些邋遢。
　　“根据霍金的时间观，过去的四川和现代的四川，实际上都是存在于同一位置，只是第四维度值不同。
　　“而当时的我们，四维度值与现代四川相同，所以说我们能相互影响，也就是说我们处在同一时间段。”
　　维克多拿起手里那把朴实而又细致的刀，满脸复杂。
　　“不知怎的，这把刀本身的第四维度值非常不稳定，本身就是在时间的长河里不断穿梭。”
　　“百万年来，我们所熟知的物体都具有稳定的四维值，不会忽然跑回去。”他想了一下，补充道。
　　“而我猜，它内部的某些结构，会使它每隔一段时间，就会积蓄能量，或是遇见契机，就像发动机点火改变三维值一般，改变自身的四维值。
　　“而韩凌枫成为了它的契机，甚至使它一同改变了周围物体的四维值，仿佛发动机爆炸一般。
　　“爆炸中心的刀四维值变化最大，回到了百余年前，我回到了几年前，其他人估计也会很快出现。
　　“还好，我们的后背与前胸没有出现在不同时间。
　　“以前我一直觉得这种理论是扯淡，世界只有三维，什么空间弯曲，时间流逝变慢，都是在三维的基础上形成的幻觉，如果说是要回到过去，也最多只能通过物体现状反推过去的状态。
　　“现在看起来，是我肤浅了。”
　　他抬头，叹气，当年白皙的脸颊变得十分粗糙。
　　“据传，月光为仙人所制，老子不过也是凡人，这把刀真正的作者，怕只能是外星人或者，大自然本身什么的了。”
　　书里说这把刀是认主的，有缘之人持此刀，能超脱三界之外。这样看来自己就是这把刀的新主了，可如今韩凌枫一点也开心不起来，反而听得后背发凉。
　　古代生产力水平落后，欺强凌弱，满山强盗，疾病横行。还有可怕的徭役和数十万人血流成河的大战。
　　手握宝刀就能成一代豪杰？别开玩笑了，就算能成，也不是他韩凌枫。
　　自己的话，估计第一战就会被砍翻的吧？

句谦把包丢在地上，裹了裹身上的衣服。他觉得自己快崩溃了，并不是他没赶到最后一班车，准确的说，是晚班的司机提前发了车，可能是司机今天很累，可能是为了几分钟的时间看某个精彩的电视节目……再或者就是与自己一样，希望早一点回家。家里什么都好，不管是家乡的炒饭还是那条大狗。
　　A城的夜晚是不安静的，句谦没有生在这样的大城考试市，很多车声，夜市缭乱的灯光让他很怀念家乡，安静的像一谭湖水的城市，还有牵牛花慢慢地长到你的窗前。
　　夜晚的车站安静的就像沉入了大海那样，只有排排路灯点点的灯光环绕在车站周围，像是璀璨的项链。远方匍匐的山脉上浮现出奇异的金边露出的黑色剪影就像是怪物的脊背。远处有零星的面包车安静地停在路边，起风了，树叶轻轻地摇摆，说不出的凉快。
　　就在这个时候，下雪了。
　　在偏南方的城市是很少下雪的，一年难得几次雪天也多半是小小的白色颗粒状，当然，A城也不例外。然而此刻，天空中飘下的慢慢地变成了一片一片，虽然是很小的一片片，但是对于句谦这种从小便生活在南方城市的学生来说，是一辈子也没有看到过的景色。
　　就像是整朵的花在风中划过。这时，一幅幅的画面在句谦的脑海里勾画，或者说是苏醒过来，貌美如花的女子在雪中舞剑，白须的老者站在一旁，远处是淡淡几笔勾勒的高山流水……
　　就在这个时候，一阵突然的阴冷传来，句谦不禁打了个机灵，他渐渐弥散的意识也被强行拉回了现实里。有什么地方不对劲，自己没有察觉到的不对劲，是什么呢？到底是什么？
　　句谦猛然醒悟过来，现在才刚刚入冬，像A城这样的南方小城，不要说在这个时候下雪，连听都没有听说过，一颗都没有更别说像现在这样的阵仗。
　　这时句谦的背后突然一阵发凉，太安静了。风声，之前树叶的沙沙声，守夜的面包车里微弱的灯光，车站旁24小时便利店的闪烁的灯光。全都消失了。他猛地从座椅上跳了起来，掏出口袋里的手机，翻到通讯薄里最低端最角落里的那个号码，它位于单独的一组之中，因为它的名字没有按照中文或者英文的首字母进行排序。电话号码“~~”，看上去有些可笑。
　　就在句谦要按下去拨这个号码之前，电话响起，铃声是烂大街的三星来电铃声，电话号码正是他刚要拨出的“~~”。
　　“你还在A城吧？紧急情况。20分钟后我在B街等你。”电话里传来年轻男子的声音。
　　果不其然，事情没有结束啊。
　　句谦，原本是像普通大学生那样，有些自己想做的事情，也有些小小猥琐心理的大大的好青年，但是就在某年暑假他的生活费被耗子吃了！！没错，天晓得现在的耗子是饿成什么个样子了，有些滑稽的这晴天霹雳让句谦是笑不出来也哭不出来，于是开始了艰辛的暑假打工生活。可是从小娇生惯养的他哪里知道钱是有多难挣啊！一番折腾下来，他还是没能挣到买论文的钱。（虽然句谦自己觉得有些别扭，但在他那些室友看来这倒是非常合理）

　　他跪坐下来，抽出细长的短刀，对着自己的小腹，紧绷双手。
　　该结束了。
　　他就这样，一直这样，竟然下不去手。
　　他的一切都充斥着澎湃、酸楚。
　　他时而起身，时而躺在地上，时而泪流满面。
　　整整一天了，他已筋疲力尽，头发紧贴着脸颊。
　　我为什么下不去手？
　　我留在世上还有何愿望？

 i really don't know what it is i typed

 & it is as hope ^-^

 and it haven't have any promise to anyone yet

 but u should do things u promise to others





# before two thousand and ninteen




# gop seed


it is a program with my learning,
maybe it's not meaningful
but it's always just meaningful to me..


just use gcc now

 cd TxL

 gcc  seed/that.c  -o  ./?

 ./?

then u can c






/*

 first

     cd ./TxL


 it's a beginning with this script

     bash ./seed/box/Linux/seed.sh


 then it will make a file named '?'

 then try again

  ok , just like that... :D
  then, you can see
